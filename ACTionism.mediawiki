=Description=

"ACTionism is the art of finding your people and taking action - together.  You know that feeling when you look around you and see what needs changing, but wonder if you're alone in caring? You're not. And you have more power than you think.    We reject the tired narrative that you're either a passive subject or an isolated consumer. What you are is an active citizen capable of creating meaningful change.   ACTionism exists to inspire you by sharing examples of ordinary people bucking the system to effect change. We also help you find your people so you can start taking collective action."
