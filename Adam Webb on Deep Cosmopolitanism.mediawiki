=Description=

Interview conducted by Elias Crim:

"Amidst a global culture war between the forces of neoliberal atomization and incorrigible fundamentalists, Adam Webb is proposing the creation of a deep cosmopolis, a global alliance of tradition-minded defenders of the poor. His own international background (UK, Spain, Peru, China)gives Webb fascinating insights into how the local and the global might combine forces."
