E.M. Burlingame:

"The proposed Anthropini Energeia Scale is a conceptual framework inspired by the Kardashev Scale, which measures a civilization’s technological progress through its ability to harness energy. However, the AES shifts the focus to the individual, evaluating a person’s capacity to utilize the full spectrum of energy within their body—not just metabolic energy from ATP, but also the energetic charge and potential inherent in cells, the nervous system, and the brain, as well as interactions with environmental electromagnetic fields (EMFs). This expanded scale recognizes that human energy encompasses bioelectricity, ion gradients, and electromagnetic interactions, offering a holistic view of human capability."

=Characteristics=

E.M. Burlingame:

"Thus, the Anthropini Energeia Scale redefines "available energy" to include:

Metabolic Energy (ATP): Energy derived from nutrients and converted into ATP through cellular respiration.

Bioelectric Energy: The electrical potentials and fields created by ion movements across cell membranes, and the cell membrane charges and potentials essential for cellular communication, nervous system activity, and tissue patterning.

Nervous System and Brain Potential: The dynamic electrical activity of neurons and neural networks, as well as glial cell activation which far exceeds ATP’s biomolecular energy production contribution by enabling bioenergetic thought, perception, and coordination.

Electromagnetic Interactions: The body’s capacity to acquire, respond to, reset with and to interact with EMF fields and charges in the environment, influencing cellular behavior and overall vitality.

The body is not an isolated system—it constantly interacts with its surroundings. It acquires environmental EMFs through exposure to natural sources (e.g., Earth’s magnetic field) and artificial ones (e.g., Wi-Fi, power lines), integrating these charges into its bioelectric framework. This interaction can either enhance or disrupt the body’s energetic coherence, depending on the nature and intensity of the fields."

=Typology=

E.M. Burlingame:

"The Expanded Human Energy Utilization Scale

The Anthropini Energeia Scale now comprises five levels, each reflecting an individual’s ability to harness and optimize this full spectrum of energy—metabolic, bioelectric, neural, and electromagnetic. Progression through the levels signifies greater control, efficiency, and harmony with both internal systems and the external environment. Greater individual human capacity.


==Level 0==

Minimal energy control

<20% of total energetic potential

- Basic survival, disrupted bioelectric and neural fields, chaotic EMF interactions


==Level 1==

Basic energy use for daily survival

20-40% of total energetic potential

- Routine tasks, functional but unoptimized bioelectricity, minimal EMF awareness


==Level 2==

Efficient energy use for moderate demands

40-60% of total energetic potential

- Moderate tasks, stable bioelectric and neural activity, growing EMF sensitivity


Level 3

High utilization for advanced performance

60-80% of total energetic potential

- Intense activities, optimized bioelectric and neural systems, active EMF engagement

==Level 4==

Near-optimal utilization for peak potential

>80% of total energetic potential (approaching 100%)

- Mastery of all energy systems, coherent bioelectric fields, conscious EMF control
