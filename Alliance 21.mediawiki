=Description=


"Our purpose is to invent, to share, and to practice new forms of collective action, from the local to the global scales, so that together we can exercise more control, together and with Nature, over the future of an increasingly complex and interdependent world.

The challenge of the Alliance is to favor unity within diversity by proclaiming our societies’ capacity to understand and assess the complexity of situations, the interdependence of the issues, and the legitimacy of all the different geocultural, thematic, social, and professional viewpoints, and to encourage them all to act accordingly."
