"The future of business is collaboration. The future of capitalism is co-capitalism. The problem is that we don't know what we really mean when we speak of co-business, and we just don't know how we can put it into practice.

In his talk, Alfons Cornella will demostrate how co-society (an initiative to encourage the systematic intersection of business between companies from different sectors, with the participation of the most innovative companies in Spain) has achieved exactly this by bringing together the smartest teams from different country's best companies to combine their expertise to generate new projects that would normally be "unlikely" to become reality, and thereby creating sustainable wealth."
