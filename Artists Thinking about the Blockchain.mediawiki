=Description=

Imperica:

"Features a number of thinkpieces, poems, and speculative works set in a context of a time "before Blockchain changed the world".

There's no doubt that Blockchain is on fire at the moment. Coins and ICOs are sprouting up every day, and large corporations are embracing the technology as a way to authenticate the movement of goods and services through associated technologies like Hyperledger Fabric. Like many technological innovations which offer a fundamental rethink of society and commerce (including the Internet itself), Blockchain is often presented as the intangible solution to a set of contemporary, tangible problems.

So, it's excellent to see a compendium of cognitive and physical works from digital artists be launched at such as critical - yet still early - time in Blockchain's evolution."
