" a lot of parametric configurators are available for YOU to design your own furniture, with parametric exploration applets " [http://www.open-electronics.org/ten-open-source-hardware-and-design-projects-setting-new-standards/]


=Description=

"AtFAB is a series of furniture objects that can be cut by a CNC router, laser cutter or water jet from any off-the-shelf sheet material. We didn't design AtFAB as the most perfect furniture, but rather designed it to be perfect for the most. You can fabricate AtFAB locally at hackerspaces or DIY storefronts like TechShop or you can find an independent fabricator through online networks like 100kGarages.com to do the work for you. Once your pieces are cut, they are easy to assemble into a finished object with simple hardware."
