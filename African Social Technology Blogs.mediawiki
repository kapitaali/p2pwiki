"Afrigadget.com - founded by Erik Hersman of Ushahidi, but includes lots of contributors. More focused on low/approtech, but fascinating, and very much worth a read: http://www.afrigadget.com/

The Ushahidi crew, in general, has some great tech blogs. (And if you're not following their project - ushahidi.com - you're missing one of the most exciting African tech projects around.)

Juliana Rotich is Afromusing - http://afromusing.com/

Erik Hersman is White African - http://whiteafrican.com/

Ory Okolloh is Kenyan Pundit - http://www.kenyanpundit.com/ - more political/policy than straight tech, but she just took over as Google's Africa policy lead

David Kobia is DKFactor - http://dkfactor.com/

Daudi Were - Mental Acrobatics - is wicked smart and deeply involved with the Kenyan geek/random hacks of kindness community - http://www.mentalacrobatics.com/...

Moving out of East Africa: WebAddicts is a great South African tech blog - http://www.webaddict.co.za/, and the author links to several other strong ZA tech blogs. David Ajao, a Nigerian internet entrepreneur in Ghana, is worth your time: http://www.davidajao.com/blog/

Not all the best stuff is on blogs. Egghead Odewale's Twitter feed from Nigeria is consistently excellent - http://twitter.com/#!/eggheader"
