=Description=

"This website is dedicated to the development and exchange of 3D-printable models, with a particular focus on models used for teaching and education. There is ample evidence that learning is enhanced through active experiences, especially when relating to spatial and physical concepts that are difficult to visualize and understand abstractly. Traditionally, dedicated educators would handcraft physical models to help demonstrate educational concepts, but such models are becoming increasingly rare due to the resources, skill and effort involved in making them, and the advent of cheaper and more flexible virtual models and computer simulations. Physical models can also aid visually impaired persons and help alleviate learning disparities associated with spatial reasoning. With the popularization of 3D-printing technologies, however, fabrication of physical models is becoming increasingly simple and readily accessible, thus enabling resurgence of this important educational medium. We hope that this website will catalyze the development, the exchange, and the motivation for creating physical models and the associated curricular materials."
