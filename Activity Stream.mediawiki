'''= An activity stream is a mash-up of an individual’s or organization’s feeds.''' [http://www.internettime.com/2009/01/11/activity-streams/]


=Description=

"As people use various different web sites to blog, update their status, post their location, or photos, sites and tools have emerged to aggregate these various actions into a continuous eclectic stream of activities. Such activities typically involve a subject (the person doing the activity), a verb (what the “doing” is of the activity), and often a direct object (what the activity is being done to or with). '''Activity stream aggregators''' typically republish activities in reverse chronological order, independent of type of activity."
