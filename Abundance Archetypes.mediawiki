>Information goods are a unique commodity - nonrival, non-material goods with diminishing/near-zero marginal cost (what Verzola calls “multiplicative abundance”)

>Several abundance archetypes may be defined


 
* '''Multiplicative abundance''' of information goods: abundance that is created when the cost of reproducing the (non-material) resource approaches zero

* '''Reproductive abundance''' of living organisms: as long as the right conditions exist for the reproductive processes to occur, ecological systems of interacting biological webs of organisms will provide us a timeless source of abundance

Two additional archetypes below are based on the massive bulk of certain elements and compounds found on Earth and elsewhere (e.g. air, water, sand, wind, minerals, solar energy). 

* '''Abundance based on persistent mass''': matter is never really destroyed - persistent matter (e.g. metals) undergoes very little chemical transformation - their persistence allows them to be reused or recycled over and over again, with little additional processing; the principle management approach for this archetype is a better system of recovering and recycling the resource, to enhance the persistence of these abundant goods for their human users

* '''Abundance of massive-dissipative resources''' - while we may start with an abundance by virtue of their bulk, the use of the resource transforms and depletes it; the principle management approach for this archetype should be conservation, to leave as much of the resource to future generations, who may discover much better ways of putting these non-renewable resources to good use

Careful though, for … Pseudo abundance - bads posing as goods (e.g. not accounting for externalities)"
