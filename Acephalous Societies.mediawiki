'''= Acephalous Societies are NOT [[Non-Competitive Egalitarian Societies]]'''

=Discussion=

Cathryn Townsend:

"Delayed-return hunter-gatherer societies (such as those of Okiek and Inuit peoples), 
big men societies (such as those of Papua New Guinean horticulturalists), and 
non-stratified lineage systems (such as those of the Tallensi horticulturalists of West 
Africa and the Yanomami horticulturalists of Brazil and Venezuela) are all [[Acephalous Societies]]
that are often misleadingly described as egalitarian because of their lack of 
enduring hierarchies and/or highly centralized leadership. However, a society that 
lacks a hierarchical leadership structure but does not conform to egalitarian principles 
in terms of its other features, such as relative gender equality, is better described as 
acephalous. Acephalous has the root meaning of headless and is thus better suited 
to describe social organization that is characterized only by the absence of top-down 
leadership or centralized power structures."
