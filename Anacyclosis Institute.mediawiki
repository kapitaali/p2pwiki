=Description=

"At the Anacyclosis Institute, we believe that this ancient model (of [[Anacyclosis]] contains much truth. We also believe that the astonishing longevity of the US Constitution, specifically designed to resist the Polybian cycle, speaks to the validity of many aspects of the theory. Nevertheless, while inspired by the anacyclosis model, '''we do not believe that human history rigidly follows any fixed evolutionary sequence. What we do believe is that a careful study of history can tell us a lot about where we are and where we are headed.''' We now have many more tools at our disposal than Polybius had for the study of historical patterns, including archaeology, economics, demographic models, and complexity theory.  One of our objectives is to use these tools to develop a more comprehensive model of political change.  "
