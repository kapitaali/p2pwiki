=== Description ===
ADEM hopes that citizens will be able to use their mobile measuring devices to learn directly about the air quality of their surroundings. A team of 20 experts developed a DIY kit so that the devices low cost, open, repairable and can be made adaptable and reproduced locally. By sharing these measurements and directly involving citizens, ADEM aims to raise awareness about the issues of health and wellness in the city, while also giving citizens a voice supported by knowledge. 

ADEM is an initiative of a group of citizens in cooperation with [[Timelab]], city lab for a society in motion.
