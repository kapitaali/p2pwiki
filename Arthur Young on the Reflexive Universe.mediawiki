Four part introduction by the author himself.


=Description=

"Cosmologist and inventor Arthur Young @ArthurMYoung introduces the ideas from his book The Reflexive Universe. The Reflexive Universe discloses a common ground between mysticism and quantum physics, between esoteric thought and the teachings of modern science. In this, his major work, Arthur Young carefully integrates scientific laws with the evolution of consciousness and develops a seminal paradigm: that quantum physics restores the spiritual origins of existence by discovering that light -- not matter -- is fundamental."
