Joseph explains:

"in the article I'm writing presently, I contrast what I refer to as 

* the ancient & pre-modern 3-function cowrie currency archetype (decentralized market-negotiated or central policy-managed [e.g. Taylor Rule] unit value based on scarcity), 

* versus the ancient 4-function barley:silver currency archetype (algorithmically adaptive standard unit value based on empirical data reflecting the primary productive capacity in the currency zone). The 3-function archetype ignores stability, favoring 'financial athletes' (speculators) over supply chain realists."
