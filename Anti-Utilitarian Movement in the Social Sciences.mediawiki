Alain Caille:

'The  specificity  of  the  anti-utilitarian  school  is  to  link  together  the
question  of  the  political  and  religious  foundation  of  societies  with  the
question  of the  gift,  of  recognition  and  of the  building  of  individual  and
collective  identities.  Its  main  hypothesis  is  that  men  are  not  only  selfinterested animals,  eager only to get and own more and more things and
riches, but that first of all they desire to be recognized (the craving for money
and richness being interpretated as the mots current translation of the need
of  recognition).  The  main  present  international  philosophical  discussion
(which is now substituting the debate abour Rawls’ Theory of Justice) now
bears  on  the  problem  of  recognition  and  identity  (Charles  Taylor,  Axel
Honneth,  Nancy  Fraser).  The  anti-utilitarian  hypothesis  is  that  Human
beings’ first desire is to be recognized and valued as givers."
