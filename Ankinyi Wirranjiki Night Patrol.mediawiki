"Ankinyi Wirranjiki Night Patrols have been a part of community life in Tennant Creek in Australia's Northern Territory going back to the 1980s.

According to the project, the Ankini Wirranjiki team, comprised entirely of indigenous people, plays a vital role in community safety, while successfully referring clients to external service providers for follow-up support."
