Kees van der Pijl:

"Bauwens and his co-authors see
the key emancipatory feature of the Internet in the ‘capacity to massively scale up
many-to-many communication, and therefore, in its capacity to lower the cost of selforganization and create and distribute value in radically new ways’. Whether these capacities are truly placed at the service of all, or specifically serve the new middle class
of technical and managerial cadre, then will depend on the strength of the popular
movement and the changes in the current property regime to satisfy its demands.

'''What distinguishes a 21st-century Big Data socialism from the labour socialism''' of
the last century, certainly once it was pushed back into the agricultural, culturally
backward (semi-) periphery of the imperialist system, is that it would not be a ‘willed’
utopia, to be realised if need be by mass coercion. It would find the IT infrastructure
largely in place and the accompanying consciousness taking shape around it—
assuming that the manipulation of the collective mindset will not develop much
further than what is happening today and that the capacity to mentally grasp the world
through autonomous, active cognition, remains intact."
