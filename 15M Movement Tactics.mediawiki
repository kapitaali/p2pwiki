- The strength of non-violence and silence (reaction to police brutality at Davis University in California). A group of students performs a nonviolent sit-in in the university and the chancellor calls the police to evict them, who sprayed the students brutally and without a word with pepper spray [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmJmmnMkuEM]. The next day the students waited for the chancellor to protest against being brutally attacked because of peacefully protesting. The chancellor refused to leave her office and meet them, and when she left the campus at night this was the overwhelming reaction of the students:

- 15mparato (pun meaning “15M for Rato” and “15M for long time”). Crowdfunding campaign to pay a law firm to sue Rodrigo Rato (former chairman of Bankia Bank) and other bank responsibles for the fraud committed by it.
The campaign, launched by the goteo.org platform, brought together in less than 24 hours the required 16.000 euros and 50 shareholders who volunteered as complainants, and dozens of internal witnesses.
“The impunity is over. In the war from the ones in the top against the ones in the bottom fear has changed sides.”

- Takepart (Tomaparte). Free tool for collaborative demands (the proposal, the funding, and the legal development) against the 1%.

Anyone may make a proposal online. The community will vote on the proposals, provide evidences and testimonies and the funding necessary to cover court proceedings through crowdfunding. Thanks to Tomaparte those who until now faced inequality in the justice system now have social, professional and financial support to take their case to the end. Lawyers and solicitors may donate time to any cause in an open and collaborative way. Documentation will be available under Creative Commons licenses and could be reused. Tomaparte is a project for the 99% suffering the abuses by the 1%. We are tired of injustice. We are tired of impunity. We want a just society and we’ll unite to get it”

- Take to the strike (Toma la huelga). Initiative to reinvent new ways to organize and lead a general strike, in an inclusive, imaginative way and reaching all sectors of the population, including those not traditionally included in the concept of strike (unemployed, housewives, self-employed, paperless, precarious workers, etc). A strike of the 99%. It has a repository for gathering initiatives and new ways to strike, and a map to place them.
“We want to be part of the strike though we are not part of collective bargaining, we want to be part of the strike, even if we are unemployed or precarious.
Because the strike is the heritage of everybody, is a right achieved collectively, a collective tool we want to use and reinvent.
Take to the Strike to invent new ways to strike. Let’s make a strike anyone can live. An open and inclusive strike. To extend solidarity networks and block financial economics and parties supporting austerity and cuts on democratic social and labor rights, to cut the roads, to block the banks that evict us. “

- Indignant marches. Marches walking the continent from Madrid to Brussels, organizing assemblies in every town and city through which they pass. In this way generate spaces for debate and share experiences learned across the continent, making the discussion not limited to the cities with greater mobilization.
New marches that came from many other parts of the country and from other countries joined the initial march. The marches would end in Brussels, bringing a message to the financial heart of Europe. At the end began a new march to Athens.

- Vaca(c)tions (Vaca-acciones). Action reinventing the idea of holidays, transforming it from “a way to disconnect from everything” into a way of connecting with others, doing actions, learning, etc. During the month of August 2011 they tour the country performing actions, assemblies and meetings through the towns and cities and adding people along the way.
“We are organizing a trip to through Spain in cars and vans during the month of August. A living, learning and enjoyment experience among diverse people, known and unknown. Inspired by the spirit of Puerta del Sol and “La Barraca” from Lorca, we want to go through the villages learning and sharing what we have lived in Sol.
When thinking of holidays we usually say “I need to disconnect” as unplugging us from some kind of mechanics of everyday life, “turn off the machine” that connects us to productivity but often disconnects us from life. The 15M allows us to question this standardised fact and think about other ways of holidays. We wish it would serve to “connect”: to connect with life, with others and with oneself.
Enjoy the human connection we have lived in Sol with strangers and diverse people. We imagine a holiday in which we use human skills to make nice things, and we think that this is possible and infinite if we do among many people.”

- Anti-markets shield. October 15, 2011, during the 15O global demonstration in Madrid, an anti-markets shield is deployed to protect against the black magic of markets. A shield produced by the psychic energy of the people present, and his trust in others. From the heights, a shaman leads the ceremony.
“Financial and political shamans threaten us. Their magic is powerful. Frighten us with omens on derivatives, financial tsunamis, subprime earthquakes, asset poisoning, inflationary curses, credit bottlenecks, risk rating… (…)
They require us trust and sacrifice. We can only save us if we sacrifice pensions, health care, public education and social services. They call it confidence, but it’s only resignation and fear. (…)
The Debt is black magic The Brent Barrel is black magic The Risk Premium is black magic The Ibex 35 is black magic The Laffer Curve is black magic The Full Employment is black magic… And in the Economy of Voodoo, the next will be you.”

- Stop evictions. Campaign to stop the evictions. They organize calls via internet, for groups of people to concentrate on the doorsteps of the people who are going to be evicted, the day the eviction will occur, and so prevent this to be carried out. Thanks to them hundreds of evictions have been stopped. They have also organized an ILP (Popular Legislative Initiative) to change the law with respect to evictions and housing.

- Xpain (eXpaña). Visibility campaign of disobedience acts carried out by the people. In addition to the visibility they invite people to send letters to the government to give up being represented by the government, to foreign embassies to stop recognizing the government as a valid spokesperson, and they grant passports from that new collective non-country that is built with each action.
“Xpain is giving a name to all those acts of disobedience that increasingly surround us in our lives and build other way of relating between each others, of defining our society: the locksmith who refuses to participate in evictions, the physician who attends immigrants without health card, the people losing their fear. Such new country that is being constructed from our private lives, from our intimate acts, but always thinking collectively. Contrary to what politicians sold us with the Spain Brand, the contrary to what they approve in their laws, to their empty talks in the media. Two worlds exist in parallel, and one is declared irrelevant each time we do one of those big and small actions of disobedience.”

- Israel loves Iran. Citizen campaign in which thousands of citizens of Israel sent a message of respect and love for the people of Iran against the messages of hate and fear that defends their government, which as they say does not represent them (the same they believe happens in Iran).

- #OccupyMordor. Pot banging and pitodromo (horndrome) for weeks at the headquarters of La Caixa, one of the banks responsible for the crisis. It reinvents the “escrache” with humor by putting it in the epic imaginary of the Lord of the Rings. The pitodromo consists in inviting the cars passing to honk if they agree with the action, creating a continuous sonic chaos and facilitating other forms of participation other than the concentration.
