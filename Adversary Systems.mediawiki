Timothy Wilken:

"Adversary process is characterized by
losing relationships between the individuals of the system.
Adversary process is by definition conflict — the struggle to avoid loss. Within an
adversary system, the sum of the whole organization is much less than the sum of the
talents, abilities, & resources of the individuals making up that system. Haskell called this
much less — the conflictor's loss.

Conflict and losing relationships severely limit efficiency, productivity, and quality of
work-life. If we humans desire more for less, we must learn to organize without conflict.
If we desire to avoid the conflictor's loss, we must learn to organize without "losing"
relationships."
