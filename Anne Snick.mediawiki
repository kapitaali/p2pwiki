Department Coordinator in the Flora Network of Expertise on Gender, Sustainability and Interconnected Economics, and former researcher at the KULeuven. Her research interests are gender, commons-based peer-production and systems thinking. Flora network develops science and innovation not about or for, but with people in poverty. The dominant notion of 'work' or 'labour' does not correspond to their experiences and/or cultural practices. In mainstream economics, the work they (can) do is not valorised, whereas the normative definition of work ('employment'), is inaccessible to them. Flora cocreates a more holistic notion of work and a more inclusive model of governance. Recent research : 'Wijze wetenschap' . Contact: annesnick@florainfo.be.
