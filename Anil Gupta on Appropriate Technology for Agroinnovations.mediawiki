"In this episode, we speak with Professor Anil Gupta of the Honey Bee Network. Professor Gupta is a true visionary in the field of appropriate technology and he has dedicated his life to furthering the cause of rural innovators and their inventions.

According to Dr. Gupta, rural innovators are solving problems at such a low cost, that we can no longer afford to ignore their hard work and creativity. His approach presents us with a new model of rural and market development that must be implemented if we are to overcome the obstacles that now face our civilization."
