""Journalism is really being remade all the time," says leading new-media academic, Adrienne Russell, who examines the underlying cultural changes that reflect the new news reality. A new style of networked journalism has taken shape in the larger media landscape based on new products, tools, new players and sensibilities.

While the rise of the web and the fall of newspapers has heightened anxieties about the watchdogging role of journalism, Russell argues that journalism is also about promoting dialogue. New social media has made the voices of the public much more central in professional news outlets. "Who is a journalist?" and "What is journalism?" is really expanding in today's world, she contends."
