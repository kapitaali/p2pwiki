=Description=

"Around a year and a half ago, a collaborative team began working on WikiHouse, an open source construction set. Its aim is to make it possible for anyone to design, share, download, adapt and 'print' out low-cost, high-performance, houses which are suited to their needs, and can be assembled quickly and without traditional construction skills: to slowly build a construction commons for the social economy, owned by everyone and accessible to anyone. Now being developed with a small community of collaborators around the world, the session will make a case for citizen-production of cities, and discuss some of the big practical challenges facing open production if it is to be genuinely disruptive."

Speakers: Alastair Parvin, Wikihouse
