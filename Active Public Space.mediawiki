"an EU co-founded project with the aim of
developing knowledge on Active
Public Space. 

Europe’s towns and
cities today face major challenges:
demographic change and its
implications for urban sprawl,
environmental issues and climate
change mitigation, maintaining social
cohesion and the protection and
development of architectural and
cultural heritage. By means of
sustainable urban development, as a
response to these challenges,
Architecture can play an integrating
and innovative role. In parallel, over
the last years, the concept of Smart
Cities as well as the application of
Smart Urban Technologies have
emerged as an outstanding
contribution to the sustainable
development of European cities. It is
this important challenge in the
conjunction of architecture, urban
planning and smart urban
technologies, which compels us to
develop Active Public Space project."
