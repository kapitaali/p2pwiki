=Description=

"AI Commons is a nonprofit organization supported by the ecosystem of AI practitioners, entrepreneurs, academia, NGOs, AI industry players and organizations/individuals focused on the common good.

The organization has gathered the best minds in academia, industry, and though leaders in AI to support the creation of a knowledge hub in AI that can be accessible by anyone, that can help inform governance, policy making, and investments around deployment of AI solutions, and be a catalyst for supporting diversity and inclusivity in how AI is deployed for sustainable development goals.

AI Commons was born in 2016 from the collective discussion and efforts of a group of individuals and organizations working towards promoting AI for Good and bringing the benefits of AI to everyone and using the technology towards social and economic improvement. The reflections, dialogs, and gatherings resulted in the identification and formulation of an open and collaborative efforts to maximize the dissemination of our common knowledge of AI."
