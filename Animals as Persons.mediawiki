=Review=

From a review by Robert Yates, see http://interface-articles.googlegroups.com/web/yates.pdf?

"Francione argues that real progress for nonhuman animals requires them to
become moral persons. He says they become moral persons ‘if we extend the
right not to be property to animals’. This idea is likely to create further
controversy for Francione, yet he explains that his conceptualisation of animal
personhood is limited and practical: ‘To say a being is a person is merely to say
that the being has morally significant interests, that the principle of equal
consideration applies to that being, that the being is not a thing.’
