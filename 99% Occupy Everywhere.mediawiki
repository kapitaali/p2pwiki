=Description=

By Kelly McCartney

"Narrated by Lou Reed, this doc looks at the wide swath of the population burned by the economic crisis, from a 22-year-old college graduate to a 92-year-old grandmother, from a Marine veteran to a police captain. They discuss issues like health care, education, the environment, income inequality, and unemployment. Economist Jeffrey Sachs ties it all together and shows what steps could be taken to creative a sustainable future for all. Footage was sourced from numerous documentarians and includes never-before-seen clips from the police crackdown in Zuccotti Park."
