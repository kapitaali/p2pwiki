=Description=

"Vancouver City Council passed a motion (PDF) to endorse the principles of “making its data open and accessible to everyone where possible, adopting open standards for that data and considering open source software when replacing existing applications.”

This afternoon, Nora interviewed Andrea Reimer, the Vancouver city councillor behind the open city motion. They talked about the costs and benefits of open data, how it can affect civic engagement, and the privacy and security concerns Vancouver will have to consider as it opens up its municipal data."
