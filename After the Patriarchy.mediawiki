=Description=

The super-ego performs the same function of protecting and saving that was fulfilled in earlier days by the father and later by Providence or Destiny.

- Freud, The Ego and the Id. 

By JULIET FLOWER MACCANNELL:

"It is not accidental that Freud makes culture a parent: it is supposed to start something and keep it going. Fundamental to all human societies is an unquestioned desire to reproduce itself in some form - any form, material, substantial, spiritual, in the next generation. Yet we are un-mistakably marked by a notable reproductive anxiety, a fear of fathering. What was once the keynote of psychosis is a general cultural mode today. The central question that I shall be addressing is whether the contemporary human community, especially but not exclusively under nuclear conditions, desires to perpetuate itself? Such a question is unaskable, but it is also serious and necessary."
