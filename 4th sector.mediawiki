A set of principles, rules and economic models that lead to a legal framework to institutionalize p2p, open and collaborative socioeconomic practices.

The 4th sector is proposed in continuity with the development of the ''public'', ''private'' and ''social'' sectors.  

=History=
The term was proposed by [[Sensorica]] during their effort to create a legal framework for the [[Collaborative Economy]] in Quebec, Canada. Sensorica published the [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RPZzvrLx1yy3_HeTYk7dhxyRnNmIk0O6GRC8zRBqbf4/edit 4th Sector Rationale] document to inform this initiative. This was done in the context of the [https://www.sensorica.co/ventures/4th-sector/NOICE?fromSearch=true NOICE project]. 

The NOICE project's main goal was to create a special economic zone in Montreal, Canada, to explore and experiment with p2p practices, [[Collaborative Economy]], [[Commons-Based Peer Production]].

The term ''4th sector''([[Fourth Sector]]) was strategically chosen by Sensoricans to relate to the past development of the 4th sector in Quebec and make it easier for politicians to digest. It provided a roadmap based on the historical achievements of [https://chantier.qc.ca/ Le Chantier de l'Economie Sociale], a Quebec advocacy group that help institutionalize the social economy in Quebec and throughout Canada. This lead to the creation of social economy ministries at the provincial and the federal level.

=Motivation=
The p2p, open and collaborative economy cannot be subsumed to the social economy. The legal forms created to channel efforts in the social economy are not adequate for open network type organizations that are prevalent in the p2p sphere. Moreover, the governance and economic models used in the p2p economy do not map into the social economy.
