"My background is on computer science and engineering, and
I have worked as an academic interdisciplinary researcher for
12 years on incentive mechanisms (both economic and non-economic)
for peer-to-peer systems  and the NetHood project, or what we have
called recently "the right to the hybrid city":
http://ci-journal.net/index.php/ciej/article/view/1092/

Since January 2016, I have quit academia and co-founded NetHood,
http://nethood.org, as an official Zurich-based non-profit organization.

We were lucky to get involved immediately in two EU Horizon 2020
CAPS projects: http://netcommons.eu and http://mazizone.eu.
They are both inter- and trans-disciplinary approaches on the concept
of DIY networking and community (wireless) networks. See also a
recent special JoPP issue: http://peerproduction.net/issues/issue-9-alternative-internets/

Through this work, and envisioning various possible synergies
between different forms of peer production, we have become
very active in two concrete areas of local collective action:
- community currencies: http://nethood.org/economy, and
- cooperative housing: http://nethood.org/housing

Our main focus is on extracting knowledge from a few concrete
success stories, like WIR/Sardex.net complementary currencies
and Zurich's "young" cooperative housing projects.

For cooperative housing, you might also find this page interesting:

and you might wish to consider joining us in Venice, October 28-30th:

For currencies, the NetHood team will be at the upcoming MoneyLab #3 in
Amsterdam, December 1-2, to present the "Flexonomix District-Currency Game":
