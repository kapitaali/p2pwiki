Clement Vidal:

"Focusing on human groups and human institutions, one can quickly forget the critical importance of also managing the geosphere and the biosphere. To address this, I propose to extend the Gaia hypothesis (Lovelock & Margulis, 1974) to Anthropogaia, this time including the feedback loops necessary to regulate the geosphere and the biosphere (see Figure 2). Anthropogaia is a neologism combining humans (anthropos) with the goddess Gaia. The half-human and half-goddess ambition is to attempt to manage and regulate both the biosphere and the geosphere. Such successful management at the planetary level should control the essential variables of the geosphere, biosphere and noosphere, so they could sustain each other in the long term and be able to continue co-evolving."
