=Description=

Arjun Appadurai:

99 Theses on the Revaluation of Value is a speculative exploration of value, emphasizing practical experimentation in its future forms:

"According to Brian Massumi, it is time to reclaim value from the capitalist market and the neoliberal reduction of life to “human capital”—time to occupy surplus-value for a postcapitalist future. In his theoretical and practical manifesto, Massumi reexamines ideas about money, exchange, and finance, focusing on how what we value in experience for quality is economically translated into quantity.


Brian Massumi has brought a rich perspective to bear on the deepest problem linking capitalism, ethics, and calculation: the problem of quality. This book offers many good reasons to see that the emphasis on number, quantity, and countability is the ruling fiction of the empire of capital and the main obstacle to the revaluation of value in both theory and practice."
