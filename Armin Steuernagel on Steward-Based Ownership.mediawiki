=Description=

"Private ownership of companies drives our economic system but it has also created corporations that put profit above everything else, a divided society and a planet on the brink of destruction. Armin Steuernagel proposes a new way to think about ownership: Steward-ownership replaces executives with leaders who are truly responsible and accountable. It creates an economy where companies are owned by the most able, not by the highest bidder and where a purpose is at the heart of every company’s DNA. 

A serial-entrepreneur and author, Armin founded his first business at the age of 16. He is co-founder and managing partner of Purpose Foundation and Purpose Capital.  He works to help companies stay mission-driven by transforming the ownership structure: they become steward owned companies. Armin is member of the Club of Rome, TT30, co-founder of the international – NGO Democracy International and co-founder of the Think Tank Neopolis Network."
