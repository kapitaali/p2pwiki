Brian Martin presents the case against intellectual property, approaching the issue from a different background to most of us in the free software movement. 

This is chapter three of Brian Martin's book [[Information Liberation]], which is now  [http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/98il/ online in its entirety]. (Other chapters cover defamation, privacy, whistleblowing, and more.)

The main arguments are also summarized by Geshan Manandhar in [[Problems with Intellectual Property]]

Danny Yee says: "You'll note that Martin confuses "freeware", "free software", and "public domain", but that's my fault, since I should have picked this up in my proofreading."
