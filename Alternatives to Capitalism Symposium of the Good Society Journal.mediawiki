=Description=

"The current issue of The Good Society, the long-running journal of the Committee on the Political Economy of the Good Society (PEGS), is devoted in its entirety to “Alternatives to Capitalism,” a symposium built around my essay (with Steve Dubb) on “The [[Possibility of a Pluralist Commonwealth and a Community-Sustaining Economy]]”.

The essay also serves as an important foundational document for a new Democracy Collaborative venture, The [[Next System Project]], a multi-year initiative aimed at developing the carefully researched and comprehensive proposals required to deal with the systemic challenges—environmental, economic, social and political—the United States faces."
