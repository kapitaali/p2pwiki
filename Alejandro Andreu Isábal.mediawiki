"I'm Alejandro, a 23 years old guy that recently finished its B.Sc in Telematics Engineering. I also participated in the [[Bottom-up Broadband]] for Europe, where I first made contact with Free Network.

Also, I'm a strong supporter of FOSS and Free Networks (as mentioned before), and I'm planning on working and contribute to these fields of knowledge in the upcoming years."
