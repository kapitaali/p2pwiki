The Agri POD is a modular building system that can serve for many kinds of building use; it is a product providing one systematic construction method that allows simplification of manufacturing and standardization of components and materials that will result in reduced cost as the product volume increases. This is a global product that can be adapted with great advantage in any climate or location in the world.
