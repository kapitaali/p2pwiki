=Description=

"The worker-recuperated enterprise and worker cooperative movements in Argentina raise fundamental
theoretical and practical questions that not only implicate the Argentine political economy but also redound
on workers confronted with outsourcing, downsizing, and arbitrary decisions by owners and managers of
capitalist enterprises. The Argentine workers so engaged represent a dramatic confrontation between the
rights of private property and the labor rights of the working class faced with unemployment and poverty.
These examples of worker autonomy have demonstrated significant departures in terms of social formations.
By their capacity to form alliances with progressive legal, community, political, and labor forces available to
them, they represent an alternative path to economic development that is predicated on worker solidarity and
democracy in the workplace. These conflictual visions of civil society are contested in the legal-constitutional,
political-institutional, and ideological-cultural arenas."
