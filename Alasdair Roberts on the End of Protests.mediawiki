" Show 198, November 27, my interview with Prof. Alasdair Roberts, author of The End of Protest. Al’s book addresses a vexing question: why, in the face of an unprecedented financial crisis, have we not seen massive protests in the street? In this study, Al posits that a combination of regulatory, social and technological forces have created this state of affairs. In our discussion, we examined the depths of this problem and what it means for speech and government operations in the future. "
