“We really look at the following: Activity (how much and what you do), audience (who’s listening) and engagement/interaction (how are people engaging you) ... So if you can break down any network in that way, you can figure out what we listen to.” [http://mashable.com/2011/06/14/empire-avenue-investment/]


=Description=

John C. Havens:

"Accountability based influence, or ABI, is complementary to current measures, but evolves the idea of reputation based on action in communities where a closed-loop context makes sense. And it’s in these contexts that social capital is most easily converted into the virtual currencies moving to the forefront of the new digital economy."

* [http://mashable.com/2011/04/14/dailyfeats-social-good/ e DailyFeats]:   has "created models in which people self-badge positive actions that then aggregate their overall “Life Score,” which CEO and co-founder Veer Gidwaney says “is a reflection of the good that you do every day.” 

* [http://mashable.com/2010/06/04/empire-avenue/ Empire Avenue], a “social stock market” that encourages users to buy and trade shares in each other to increase virtual currency: "By buying stock in someone online, you’re declaring them to be socially credit-worthy. Investment implies a literal endorsement of another member’s character and reputation. The service has created a paradigm in which user’s scores could eventually be utilized for reputation scoring outside of the platform. Positive reputation within the community could translate to increased credit and benefits outside." [http://mashable.com/2011/07/28/social-media-influence-accountability/]

* [http://rypple.com/ Rypple], a social performance platform for goals, feedback and recognition. “The idea is that all ongoing feedback, both positive and constructive, helps build an employee’s real reputation at work. The service lets users create custom badges, but the focus on feedback goes deeper than simple game mechanics. Features like “Loops” let users provide ongoing and actionable critiques of colleagues so feedback can be assessed at any time."
