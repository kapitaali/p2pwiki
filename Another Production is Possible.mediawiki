=Description=

"This is the second volume, after Democratizing Democracy, of the collection Reinventing Social Emancipation: Towards New Manifestoes. Here, the author examines alternative models to capitalist development through case studies of collective land management, cooperatives of garbage collectors and women's agricultural cooperatives. He also analyzes the changing capital-labor conflict of the past two decades and the way labor solidarity is reconstituting itself under new forms from Brazil to Mozambique and South Africa."
