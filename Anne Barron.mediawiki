"Ms Barron's research centres on copyright and related rights, and, more
generally, the legal regulation of culture and the arts and legal and
social theory. She is currently working on a book on the institution of
copyright – provisionally entitled Understanding Copyright: Explanatory
Frameworks and Justificatory Theories – which brings this research
together with a view to providing a comprehensive map of the
contemporary field of theoretical inquiry in relation to copyright law.":

=Excerpt=

Introduced by J. Martin Pedersen:

She works on some sort of "radical" liberal front - making sense of the
institution of copyright from a cultural (and, obviously, public sphere)
perspective:

"........too much has been made of the distinction, and that the debate
over which paradigm [what Glynn Lunney has called 'copyright's
incentives-access paradigm' on the one hand, and proponents of what Mark
Lemley has called the 'full value' or 'absolute protection' paradigm on
the other] should have priority in determining the contours of copyright
policy distracts attention from a more fundamental issue - the hegemony
of economic analysis generally in organising the conceptual and
normative universe of legal scholars working in this area. Thus while
sympathetic to the impulse underlying the efforts of Lemley and
Frischmann - a concern to resist the seemingly relentless expansion of
copyright towards the horizon of absolute right-holder control of all
uses of copyright material - I argue that their lingering adherence to
the presuppositions of economic analysis has stymied their well-meaning
efforts to account for the social value of 'information' in terms
distinct from the merely economic measure of price. My overall aim here
is to suggest that, because of its presuppositions, economic analysis -
in whatever paradigm it may be packaged - offers at best a blinkered
perspective on both copyright law and the field of social life that
copyright law affects. I conclude by proposing Jurgen Habermas's social
theory as an alternative framework in relation to which critics of
copyright expansionism might fruitfully orient themselves in the future."
