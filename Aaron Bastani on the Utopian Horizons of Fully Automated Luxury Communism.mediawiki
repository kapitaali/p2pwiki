==Description==

"Aaron Bastani joins the podcast to discuss his new book, Fully Automated Luxury Communism: A Manifesto. We touch on automation, gene editing, free energy, and the trajectories the surprising progress of these new technologies could lead us on.

Utopian Horizons is a podcast about utopia. Each episode covers a different utopia, dystopia, utopian thinker, or utopian movement, asking what they can tell us about ourselves, our society, and our future."
