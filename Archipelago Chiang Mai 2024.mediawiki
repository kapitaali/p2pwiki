= Archipelago ,  A month-long network of pop-up communities in Chiang Mai, Thailand 

URL = http://pelago.city

=Description=

"The Archipelago is a gathering of coliving and coworking pop up villages/camps/islands in the same place and at the same time as neighbors in a pop up city. There is no central organizing team. Each island has their own organizers.

Taking place

* between Token 2049 [📍Singapore | September 17-22] and 

* DevCon [📍Bangkok, Thailand | Nov 9-12]

"Mission: To foster a global network of communities to advance humanity by creating playgrounds at the intersection of free and open technology, health, science and social innovation."

"Perhaps this new wave of pop up cities could lead us to answer a vital question:

How do we scale up society while remaining connected with our own tight-knit community?

The solution is '''to create many Dunbar number sized communities who cross-coordinate in a confederation'''. In this way, both sides may win."
