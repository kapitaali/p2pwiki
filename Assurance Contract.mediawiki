Mike Linksvayer:

"'''An assurance contract returns contributions (or cancels pledges) in case the amount requested is not raised'''. A [[Dominant Assurance Contract]] returns contributions plus a failure payoff or refund bouns, making it worthwhile for interested parties to contribute even if they believe the contribution threshold will not be met. Both concepts could easily be applied to [[Reverse Bounties]]."
