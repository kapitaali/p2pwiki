'''= an attempt to create a [[Distributed Programmable Organization]] that works for the commons economy, by SenseLab in Montreal, Canada'''

=Description=

SenseLab:

"The SenseLab’s Immediations project is working intensively to develop a self-sustaining micro-economy of abundance fostering emergent collectivity arising at the intersection of art, philosophy, and activism. The [[3E Process Seed Bank]] will embody the principles of a key concept that the Immediations project has been developing called the “anarchive.” The 3E Process Seed Bank will serve as the “creative process engine” for the 3 Ecologies Institute alter-university project. The 3E Process Seed Bank will be open source. It will be offered to other cooperatives as a template to be adapted to their needs. Toward this end, we are intensively engaged with exploring collaborations with innovators such as the Economic Space Agency (ECSA, [http://ecsa.io]) and Holochain ([https://holochain.org])."
