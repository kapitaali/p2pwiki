François Hartog:

"While we can detect a certain awareness of an apocalyptic literary genre in Judeo-Christian and Manichean literature, it remained inchoate until the modern period, when it was taken up by Johannes Fabricius in 1722. Over the course of the nineteenth century, other authors followed his lead. Then, in 1947, the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls expanded the corpus and triggered lively debates about the place of apocalypticism in the Jewish tradition and in early Christianity. Still, if it is appropriate to speak of a genre, laid down over time, we must not lose sight of the fact that its two founding texts, continuously reread and reinterpreted, were the book of Daniel and the book of Revelation—more specifically Daniel 12 and Revelation 20, especially with regard to the perennial speculation over dates."
