=Description=

“Explores how we can redesign the village for the 21st century. Through conversations with innovators, entrepreneurs, and community builders, we document our journey of building a family-friendly eco-village in Koh Phangan, Thailand, with an intentional vision for the future of living, working, and education.

Using a venture builder model, we’re experimenting our way forward, learning from others worldwide about what works and what doesn’t as we go from idea to reality—blending ancient wisdom with modern lifestyle design.”
