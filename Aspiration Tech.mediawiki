=Description=

"'''Aspiration connects nonprofit organizations with software solutions that help them better carry out their work'''. We want nonprofit organizations to obtain and use the best software to maximize their effectiveness and impact so that they, in turn, can change the world. We identify what is available and what is missing in the nonprofit and NGO software arena. We foster relationships, delivery systems, and sustainability strategies between NGOs and their tech support organizations around the world."
