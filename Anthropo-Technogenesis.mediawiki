Nathan Gardels:

"Just as humans are not above and apart from nature, technology is not apart from us. It is not external to the human condition.  Rather, it is technology that makes us human. Human becoming through the tools we invent to survive and thrive in the environment in which we are embedded is part and parcel of our evolution. Anthropogenesis is technogenesis.

Thus, aligning anthropo-technogenesis with “the order of the cosmos,” not repudiating technology, is the summons our evolutionary lineage is now called upon to fulfill. Just as the technological prowess of Sapiens has deformed the planet in a way that has produced the current climate crisis, so might technology imbued with a new eco-logic help “terraform” the planet in the opposite way? Some have called this potential “the Good Anthropocene.”

Shifting the impetus within technogenesis is an aspect of cultural transformation — not as a substitute for, but a vital complement to, the human element.

This contrasts with the anti-technological vision of deep ecology that leads into a cul de sac of stasis as the world moves on."
