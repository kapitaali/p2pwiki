The P2P Foundation is a registered non-profit with ANBI status based in the Netherlands.

"Since 2008 the Dutch Tax Administration can designate an institution to be an "Public Benefit Organisation" (Dutch: Algemeen Nut Beogende Instelling, ANBI). At least 90% of the efforts of an ANBI has to be focused on the general good. And since 2012 the 'culturele ANBI' can profit (until at least 2018) from even more Dutch tax advantages."
