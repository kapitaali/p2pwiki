=Description=

"The foundation of computer engineering is code, while the foundation of humanities research is concepts—rigorously defined, rich in meaning, and meticulously sourced concepts serve as the very building blocks of humanities writing. Based on this premise, this product will focus on the collaborative production and organization of concepts: imagine being able to quickly and accurately locate the meaning and sources of a particular academic concept; imagine being able to trace how the same term takes on different meanings across various works, authors, and disciplines; various works, authors, and disciplines; imagine if the bulk of a humanities scholar's work—literature reviews, conceptual analysis, reading notes—could be preserved and shared rather than discarded like worn-out scraps.

How does this differ from existing tools such as Wikipedia and other collaborative dictionary platforms designed for humanities scholars? In truth, any dictionary that deals with humanities concepts must confront the inherent tension between specialization and the polysemy (poetic ambiguity) of terms. Existing tools attempt to ensure scholarly rigor by appointing entry curators or inviting experts to author definitions, but in practice, this results in a monopoly over meaning, diminishing the diversity that is the hallmark of the humanities. This approach, rooted in a mass-media mindset that seeks to eliminate "ambiguity," ultimately leads to intellectual homogenization, a phenomenon that should be viewed with caution, both in academic discourse and in everyday language."
