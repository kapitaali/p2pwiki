Joe Brewer:

'Another important structure used by Occupy
was the swarm
where a leaderless movement
emerged spontaneously in multiple locations all
at once. The key organizational frame behind
this behavior is the
Activation Network Frame — where multiple nodes of a network are
constantly monitoring for threats and each is
able to engage in rapid response to changes in
the local environment. Examples of the
activation network include the hive behavior of social insects and the immune response of
a complex multi-cellular organism.

Social insects (bees, wasps, termites, etc.) constantly monitor the chemical trails left by
individual members of their hive and respond quickly to the release of stress markers in the
proximity of a new predator or some other disruption to their normal routines. Multi-cellular
organisms have special cells within their bodies—one example being the lymphocytes in
the blood of mammals that attack viruses and tumors before they are able to spread—that
float throughout the body and respond locally when a harmful contagion is discovered.

The key features of an activation network are
decentralization and localized rapid engagement. The Occupy Movement spread quickly as local community members organized themselves into encampments and protest actions. There were no visible
leaders who could be targeted across the movement and specific actions reflected the
local character of each group and the concerns they rallied around."
