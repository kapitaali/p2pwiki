"Born and raised in Brussels, I also lived in Spain and in Netherlands

In these three places, I've found my true passion for writing first when I investigated the Gypsy community in Seville then, when I worked at a newspaper in Brussels and finally, when I studied new media in Amsterdam.

I'm a counter-culture enthusiast and I've just completed my Master thesis on Fab Labs, Open Design, peer-to-peer production and the DIY movement."
