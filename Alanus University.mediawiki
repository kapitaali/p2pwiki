"Alanus University is a state-approved private University of Arts and Social Sciences. It is a place of arts-based education and academic research. In 2005 “Rethinking the Economy” became a core area of both Alanus’ teaching and research. Recently, eleven laureates of the Alternative Nobel Prize (such as Nicanor Perlas, Sulak Sivaraksa and Swami Agnivesh) gathered at Alanus on the occasion of a two-day conference entitled “Re-orientating Modern Education” in order to discuss educational strategies of nourishing and growing the human capabilities of critical insight, moral maturity, and social engagement."
