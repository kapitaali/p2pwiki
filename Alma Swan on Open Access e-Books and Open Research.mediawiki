=Description=

"In this podcast I talk with Alma Swan from Key Perspectives. Over the past 5 years in which Open Access publishing has undergone considerable growth, Alma has been a reference point, providing useful and authoritative research and analysis into the progress of the Open Access movement, drawing upon her experience in both scholarly communications and the natural sciences. We begin by talking about trends in the core area of Open Access publishing - namely journal articles - and then extend our view to the potential growth of Open Access e-Books. We also look at the emerging area of open research data, examining both the potential benefits to research and to society as a whole, as well as considering the significant challenges to be overcome. This podcast provides a useful snapshot of the Open Access movement as well as insights into its future."
