=Description=

"While peer to peer systems and applications are now quite mature and widely used on fixed networks for a variety of uses (voice over IP, video streaming, file sharing...), only few attempts were made to use the concepts and techniques of peer to peer systems in mobile networks. Indeed, several constraints due to the specificities of mobile networks prevent the deployment of mobile peer to peer applications.

Mobile network operators prevent the spread of peer to peer applications on their networks for economical reasons, because peer to peer applications compete with services they offer. Besides, the signalling overhead introduced by peer to peer systems involves an increase in the traffic on mobile data networks, while the IP connectivity over cellular networks is a limited resource.

Nevertheless, the tremendous increase of the capabilities of mobile network terminals and new approaches taking into account the specificities and constraints of GPRS, EDGE, UMTS and LTE mobile data networks tend to ease the deployment of peer to peer systems by tackling the specific issues of these networks.

This project presents the design of a peer to peer overlay networks mixing both mobile and fixed clients, where mobile nodes collaborate with fixed nodes for resource-intensive operations, such as signalling or discovery operations which consume a lot of network resources."
