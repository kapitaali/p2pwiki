"'''Antiauthoritarianism is a specifically philosophical thesis that says that people are not bound to any non-human authority''', be it God, Reality, or Reason.  In this sense, for example, Protestantism, in the West, was a step towards antiauthoritarianism because it located the House of God within each person, rather than a relation only attainable through a priest caste that had a special relation to God.  On the other side of this sea change, it forced authority to be reconstituted as something that was generated by humans’ interactions with each other (otherwise there would be something like theological anarchy)."
