==Description==

"The "[[Circular Economy 2.0]]" is a model addressing the two universal challenges Humanity is facing: social inequalities and resource mismanagement.

In "Circular Economy 2.0", the focus is on providing well-being for all humans applying the 'Circular Thinking' of creating positive feedback loops regenerating life on Earth while embedding Humans so they are part of their survival equation.

A [[Circular Humansphere]] is inserted to help individuals, public or private organisations decide from such a 10 outcome based dashboard on better design.

The first conference on "Circular Economy 2.0" was organised by Sitra Finland (Innovation Fund of the Finnish Parliament) on November 1st 2018."
