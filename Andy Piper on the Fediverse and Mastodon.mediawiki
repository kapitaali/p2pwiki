Kathleen Chu:

"In a digital landscape dominated by profit-driven tech giants that monetize attention and exploit user data, Mastodon's Andy Piper presents a liberating alternative. This episode explores how the Fediverse, with Mastodon at its center, is creating a more open, user-controlled social media ecosystem. Discover how decentralized networks let you own your digital presence, connect across platforms, and escape the engagement-maximizing algorithms designed to keep you scrolling.

Join Andy, Head of Communications at Mastodon and formerly with Twitter (now X) and IBM, as he explains why distributed, community-owned social networks offer more resilience, control, and authentic connection than closed corporate platforms like Facebook and X. Learn how the Fediverse empowers users to take back control of their attention and data while fostering diverse communities with localized moderation. This conversation offers essential insights for anyone tired of being the product in surveillance capitalism and ready to reimagine their social media experience."
