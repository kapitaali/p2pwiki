=Summary=

"To egalitarian groups that  want to stay so, we could  thus propose the following ethics: to not reduce any force of internal differentiation, for fear that it becomes  vertical, but instead to  increase it in all directions, to enrich  the range of identities available: this is probably the best way not to flatten the  (many) relationships within the group and turn them into one  two-term relationship  - dominating, dominated. In this way, the construction of our collective histories  can stand a chance of no longer being at the mercy of the passions that affect it, subjugate it, and often sadden it: it would play  with these passions, which would become joyful - including, yes, the passion for distinguishing oneself."
