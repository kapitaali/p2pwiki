Akop P. Nazaretyan:

"The Russian physicist Alexander Panov (2005) added a new trait to this model when he confronted '''the time intervals between the qualitative leaps in the evolution of Earth, nature and society'''. By using geo-chronological tables and human-induced global crises since the Lower Paleolithic, he found that  the time spans decreased over the course of 4.5 billion years in conformity with a simple logarithmic formula. This result, reported to the State Astronomic Institute (November 2003), was recognized as a scientific discovery by the participants. Panov's equation was conceptually pre-empted by Graeme Snooks (1996), who had formulated the ‘law of cumulative genetic change’: each great transformation of life was one-third the duration of its predecessor. This independent discovery offers complementary evidence for the unity of the Universal History, and a new context for global forecasts."
