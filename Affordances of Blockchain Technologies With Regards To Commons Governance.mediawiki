David Rozas:

"The identification and conceptualisation of a set of affordances of blockchain technologies with regards to commons governance, which we summarise below:

* Tokenisation: refers to the process of transforming the rights to perform an action on an asset into a transferable data element (a token) on the blockchain.

* Self-enforcement and formalisation of rules: refer to the process of embedding organisational rules in the form of smart contracts that embed, partially, commons-based governance logics.

* Autonomous automatisation: refers to the process of defining complex sets of smart contracts which may be set up in such a way as to make it possible for multiple parties to interact with each other. This is analogous to software communicating with other software today but in a decentralised manner.

* Decentralisation of power over the infrastructure: refers to the process of communalising the ownership and control of the technological artefacts employed by the community through the decentralisation of the infrastructure they rely on, such as the collaboration platforms employed for coordination.

* Transparentisation: refers to the process of opening the organisational processes and the associated data by relying on the persistence and immutability properties of blockchain technologies.

* Codification of trust: refers to the process of codifying a certain degree of trust into systems which facilitate agreements between agents without requiring a third party."
