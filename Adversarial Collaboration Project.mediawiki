=Description=

"As originally conceived by Economics Nobel Prize Laureate, Daniel Kahneman, adversarial collaborations call on scholars to: 

(1) make good faith efforts to articulate each other’s positions (so that each side feels fairly characterized, not caricatured); 

(2) work together to design methods that both sides agree constitute a fair test and that they agree, ex ante, have the potential to change their minds; 

(3) jointly publish the results, regardless of “who wins, loses or draws” on which topics."
