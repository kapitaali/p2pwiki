"Allied Media Projects cultivates media strategies for a more just, creative and collaborative world. We serve a network of media makers, artists, educators, and technologists working for social justice.

Our definition of media includes all forms of communication, from videos and websites to theater, dance, design, and interactive technology. Through the Allied Media Conference and the Sponsored Projects program, AMP shares and supports models for using media for transformative social change.

Our work is grounded in Network Principles developed and evolved through dialogue with our uniquely diverse and collaborative community of participants.

We are based in Detroit, MI. Our network includes people and organizations from more than 150 towns and cities across the U.S., Canada, and abroad."
