'''= small-footprint, low cost Microfactories, using cell-based assembly'''

URL = https://arrival.com/?id=4


=Description=

"Every Arrival vehicle is produced in small-footprint, low cost Microfactories. Microfactories use our new method of cell-based assembly instead of the traditional automotive production line. They can be deployed quickly – making use of existing commercial spaces and producing any type of vehicle to meet demand.
Serving local communities

Each Microfactory serves a city and its community – sourcing from the local area and developing custom vehicles for the region they’re in. By localising the supply chain, Microfactories help to reduce the environmental impact of manufacturing."
