"The Circular Humansphere depicts an advanced approach of the current Circular Economy model where Humans are considered as our third stock of resources and flows.

The objective of the Humansphere is to design our next economic model by redefining the roles of Humans based on four Strategies so that we ensure our next economy is an inclusive one while avoiding consumption rebound.

The Circular Humansphere is a decision-making tool (The Golden Circular Rule) based on the availability of this additional stock and flows at any point in time, used in new innovative ways to enhance our roles and start perceiving Value (so far only humans do, but who knows...). The Golden Circular Rule is about prioritizing our decisions in this order: grow the Natural Capital, spread the Human Capital, then enhance the Remanufactured Capital. 

There are two main business models to add to the current Circular Economy ones:

1. Humans-as-Resources: whereby we are considered stock/flows of matter and energies with the objective of using them to rebuild the Biosphere (Humans = Nature). 

The two applicable strategies are the Adaptative (the loop from the Humansphere to the Biosphere) and Evolution (the feedback loop from the Biosphere into the Humansphere) ones;


2. Humans-as-Services: whereby we are considered stocks and flows of insatiable energies with the objective of enhancing the value of the Technosphere (Humans = Power).


The two applicable strategies are the Valorization (the loop from the Humansphere to the Biosphere) and Advancement (the feedback loop from the Biosphere into the Humansphere) ones;

The underlying concept behind it is what is now known as the "Circular Economy 2.0" where [Poverty = Waste] in a sense that they have both been human inventions in the first place. The measurement of the well-being in a systemic model thus becomes the "Optimization of Circular Value" (#OCV, explained on Linked In). 

Details of these approaches are all embedded in this video, while explanations are freely available on Linked In (articles written under the profile: Alexandre Lemille).":
