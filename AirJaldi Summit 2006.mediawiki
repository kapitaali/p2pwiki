=Description=

'''The AirJaldi Summit will address some of the ways that wireless solutions can be used to provide affordable Internet access in rural communities'''. 

"The conference will focus on the advantages that wireless networks can provide, by
enhancing the quality of education, governance and health-care, increasing
economic development, and promoting cultural exchange. Special emphasis will
be placed on identifying best practices for rapidly increasing connectivity
for regions most in need. Summit keynoters and speakers will include social
activists, IT opinion leaders, philanthropists, and international technology
professionals. The AirJaldi Summit will also provide an opportunity for
participants to share the lessons learned from the Dharamsala Community
Wireless Mesh Network, a successful example of a sustainable technology
integration model. With its unique combination of low-cost yet robust
technology, community-based implementation, and relatively large scale, the
Dharamsala project is an appropriate model for many rural areas around the
world. On the fourth day of the summit, field trips will be undertaken to key
sites around Dharamsala where mesh antennas are installed, providing
participants a firsthand understanding of the project. Following the summit,
the World Summits on Free Information Infrastructure (WSFII) Association – an
AirJaldi strategic partner – will lead a two-week workshop on various aspects
of wireless technologies, to provide hands-on training for conference
participants and the public at large."
