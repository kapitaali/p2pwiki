Silke Helfrich:

"This is the result of the work of the Thematic Groups from the "Thematic Social Forum, Capitalist Crisis, Social and Environmental Justice". The facilitators of the process did a great job in pulling all this together and getting the whole work done in 4 languages right before the People Summit starts. And we as Thematic Group on the Commons, which I had the pleasure to facilitate, did as well :-) in getting the commons pretty well integrated into the whole."
