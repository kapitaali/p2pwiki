"Currently a freelance researcher in Istanbul, I'm working on a coop initiative among scholars/researchers with high levels of job insecurities acting as commons collective. We have exciting ideas flowing in about trans-nationalizing the initiative on common grounds, so your suggestions would be most welcome. The platform cooperativism event I attended in 2015 at the New School, NY opened new horizons to the civic solidarity networks I've been contributing since late '90s."
