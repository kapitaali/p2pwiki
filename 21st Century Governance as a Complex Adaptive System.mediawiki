The Information Revolution combined with connective                      
technologies creates a unique global social network. This                
network is vulnerable to cascades of information, norms, and             
coordinated action. The inherent unpredictability of the                 
information society demands new kinds of governance that
focus on rapid network-coordinated response over centralized
predictive planning.
