From Bangalore, [[India]]: Alternative Law Forum

=Description=

Sent by Frederick Noronha:

"ALF perceives itself simultaneously as a space that provides
qualitative legal services to marginalized groups, as an autonomous
research institution with a strong interdisciplinary approach working
with practitioners from other fields, as a public legal resource using
conventional and unconventional forms of creating access to
information, as a centre for generating quality resources that will
make interventions in legal education and training, and as finally a
platform to enable collaborative and creative models of knowledge
production."
