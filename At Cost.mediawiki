'''At Cost''' means the [[Cost]]s of [[Physical Sources]] have been recovered, but [[Profit]] is not collected except as pre-payment toward future production.

Any [[Price Above Cost]] paid by a user is treated as that user's investment in more [[Physical Sources]] so that user eventually has access to At Cost products as a side-effect of his ownership.

For example, the partial owner of an apple tree (a [[Physical Source]]) owns a percentage of those apples '''At Cost''' even before they are produced.
