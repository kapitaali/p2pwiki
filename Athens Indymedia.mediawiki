=Description=

"Athens Indymedia is an open collectivity of people who offer grassroots, non-corporate, non-commercial media coverage for Athens and the rest of Greece.

Athens Indymedia is part of a global participartory network of journalists that report on political and social issues. It is originated during the anti-WTO protests worldwide in 1999 and remains closely associated with the global justice movement, which criticizes neo-liberalism and its associated institutions. Indymedia uses an open publishing and democratic media process that anybody may contribute.

There is  also a calendar of daily events [demonstrations, discussions, etc.] in many Greek cities (Patras & Thessaloniki have their own Indymedia website but are also covered by Athens Indymedia’s calendar)."
