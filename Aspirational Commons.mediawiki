Annie Leonard:

“The aspirational commons: hope, passion, commitment, the future. These belong to all of us, and it is up to all of us to protect and nourish them – because a society without hope and passion, and without possibility-rich future, is a dreary society indeed. And, of course our democracy: it belongs to all of us and only works when we engage”.

"How can we encourage people to see our hopes, our dreams, our passion, our future as something that is shared? All of these are so often viewed in just an individual context, but not as something shared by us all when in fact, of course, our future depends on the actions that we all take now, not just the actions that we ourselves take. Hence the vital importance of encouraging people to consider what their hopes and dreams are, and then place them in the context of our collective future. I like this idea of ‘nourishing the future’. What can we do today that will nourish the future. And it is only together that we will be able to realise our individual aspirations. To paraphrase Margaret Thatcher, ‘There is no such thing as the individual”."
