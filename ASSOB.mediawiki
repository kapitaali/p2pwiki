'''= Australian fund for [[Equities-Based Crowdfunding]]'''


=Description=

Paul Niederer:

"There are not many in the equities based crowdfunding space because there is so much regulation around it. ASSOB has spent 22 years building a platform that facilitates funding from friends, family, fans and followers of a business. $120 million over 5 years for 200 companies.

Although an Australian site the compliance and systemetised capital raising process could be customised to most legislative environments."
