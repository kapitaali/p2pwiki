""The Action Foresight “Global Swarm” is an assembly of friends and colleagues who come together to collaborate, scale and mutualize resources for big challenges, high impact foresight projects and our shared commons. We are a geographically, culturally, and professionally distributed team of researchers, innovators, and practitioners whose plurality of perspectives facilitate our collective creativity, enabling us to better formulate methodologies, capture discoveries, and perform analysis that best addresses the complexity of our contemporary challenges. Our collective creativity is facilitated by our plurality of perspectives and our shared vision of enabling plural futures. Our track record represents our value and ability to surface and empower subaltern and outlier perspectives and engender preferred futures."
