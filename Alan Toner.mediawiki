=Bio=

"Alan Toner, intellectual property and communications researcher, lost between New York, Buenos Aires, Rome, Berlin and Dublin. Mixing law, alcohol [[Critical Wine]], politics and media in various languages since 1973. Some people may have met me as a fellow at the Information Law Institute and the Engelberg Center on Law and Innovation at New York University or around the World Summit on the Information society when I worked with WSIS: We Seize!, but I’m now a freelancer. 

Current Interest: The new Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Directive ([[IPRED2]]), which I oppose. See the [[FFII]] page dedicated to the question. I’m still following conflicts in Argentina related to pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, and the ongoing fights around peer production, p2p and piracy."
