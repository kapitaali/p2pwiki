"[[Algorithmic Culture]] is a label for the entangled, sometimes disturbing, sometimes funny state of cultural formation that humans have entered by producing algorithms that operate online on such a massive scale and at such a fundamental level of societal organisation that they play a key role in producing culture. In this programme the term ‘bot’ is used in a broad sense to include all algorithmic agents that operate without direct supervision of humans, but that present the results of their functioning to humans.
