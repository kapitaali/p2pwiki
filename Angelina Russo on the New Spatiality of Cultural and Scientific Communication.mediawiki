=Description=

"Whether we like it or not, the internet has evolved to create a new spatiality, one that is built on communication and curiosity. Social media or web 2.0 technologies have extended this format to enable audiences to connect to organisations and to each other, in their own time and on their own terms. No longer can we build towers to knowledge and expect that people will come. The social consciousness of the internet is now the mass participation of its audiences.

This lecture will explore the impact of these changes and subsequent transformations in cultural and scientific communication in the cultural sector.

This seminar is presented by Angelina Russo as part of the Institute for Social Research lunchtime seminar series for 2009."
