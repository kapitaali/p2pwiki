=Description=

"Aquapioneers is an open source hardware and software project born at the Green Fab Lab of Barcelona, from a combination of Guillaume Teyssié’s open source aquaponic project during the FabAcademy 2016 (http://bit.ly/1TukNF1) and Loic Legoueff’s earlier contact with Aquaponics back in Israel (http://bit.ly/1sxBUim).

It's vision is to locally promote Aquaponics as a means of sustainable food production in urban areas, using Barcelona as a living Lab and aligning itself with the Green FabLab’s commitment to sustainability and self-sufficiency. 

In the meantime, it also aims to provide a global open platform of R&D and education, using the power of open source tools combined with the collaborative intelligence of Fab Lab network to inspire and be inspired."
