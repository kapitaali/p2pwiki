=Description=

"An open-source distributed library for sharing and preserving art, history and culture. Imagine a platform like Youtube, Soundcloud, or Netflix - without any of the costly server or bandwidth overhead. Users can self-publish anything, including videos, music, books, 3D-printables, recipes, and more. Content creators have complete control over how their work is published with several different monetization options. Only the publisher has the power to remove her/his content from the library.

What Bitcoin did for money, Alexandria will do for digital content publishing and distribution by removing central points of failure and financially incentivizing users around the world."
