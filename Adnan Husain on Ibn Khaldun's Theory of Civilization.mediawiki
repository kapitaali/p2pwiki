=Description=

"Simultaneously a philosopher and a historian, and often considered to be "the first sociologist," Ibn Khaldun was among the first proper "social scientists" to develop a "science of society" - something quite close to what we today call "historical materialism." What insights can the work of a 14th century Mideval Arab thinker give us often today? Quite a lot, actually. Ibn Khaldun's insights on the cyclical rise and decline of civilizations, political power, religion, "Royal Authority" and his famous (but misunderstood) concept of "Asabiyyah" ("Group feeling"), were not only ahead of his time, but also have a lot to teach us today.  To unpack the key ideas of Ibn Khaldun and discuss interpretations of The Muqaddimah, I am joined by professor Adnan Husain, a historian at Queens University who specializes in Middle Eastern history and Medieval European history."
