=Description=

"Angel Economics is an alternative economic system. It is a model of how the basic elements that make up what we call 'the economy' could be arranged. 

It is defined by six basic features. It is: open, participatory, democratic, non-monetary, free, and multiform. These features designate its fundamental institutions; this outline describes them. It also describes three significant characteristics (there will be many others) of Angel Economics – technological sophistication, a two-hour work day, and its civilized character – which would naturally result from those institutions."
