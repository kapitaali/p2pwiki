=Description=

"Jose María Arizmendiarrieta was the guide and inspiration for the group of cooperatives in the town of Mondragon, in northern Spain. They were highly successful during his lifetime, and today (when seen as a single unit) are the largest worker co-op in the world. Arizmendiarrieta (often shortened to Arizmendi) published hundreds of articles, but never wrote a book. This work is not a biography, but a systematization of his thoughts on an extensive list of subjects. When finished, it will be far and away the longest book available in English about him."
