Aaron Shaw on Polanyi's Penguin: Commons-Based Industry in the Neoliberal Knowledge Economy:

"In this talk, Shaw revisits the relationship between Commons-Based Peer Production and the market in the context of the global Information Technology industry. He argues that the logic of production underlying commons-based innovation strategies in the field of IT does not contradict ideologies of the free market." Produced 19 May 2009.
