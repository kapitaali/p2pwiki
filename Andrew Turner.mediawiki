" I'm a neogeographer involved in helping build the geospatial web. My startup is Mapufacture, where we're building a system that makes it easy for people to build and share collaborative maps and customize their slice of the GeoWeb. 

I also develop a number of other open-source tools such as GeoPress, Mapstraction, and I also wrote the book "[[Introduction to Neogeography]]" for O'Reilly."
