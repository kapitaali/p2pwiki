"In the old world products were scarce - this meant that companies who provided product could profit from the demand.

In the digital world, where abundance is key (creating a digital copy costs next to nothing) it is a customer's attention that has become scarce. This means that the customer now holds the value - not the company."

==Description==

Alex Iskold [http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/attention_economy_overview.php]:

"The basic ideas behind the Attention Economy are simple. Such an economy facilitates a marketplace where consumers agree to receives services in exchange for their attention. The ultimate purpose is of course to sell something to the consumer, but the selling does not need to be direct and does not need to be instant. For example news feeds illustrate the point well, since they ask for consumers attention in exchange for the opportunity to show him/her advertising. The Search engines are similar in that respect, because they show ads in exchange for helping users find answers online.

It is important to realize that the key ingredient in the attention game is relevancy. As long as a consumer sees relevant content, he/she is going to stick around - and that creates more opportunities to sell. Literally, the longer a user stays on a site reading news etc, the higher the chance that person will click on an ad. So the question is: how do you show the user relevant content? This is a complex problem that can be partially addressed by recommendation engines. However, it is not possible for sites to generate relevant, personalized content unless they know the user. To personalize, web sites need to know you: your browsing history, the books you like, the wines you drink, the music you listening to, etc. The more information the better.

Another key ingredient of the Attention Economy is privacy. The challenge is not just to protect consumers information, the challenge is to put the user in control of her information. The notion that in an Attention Economy, a user's information is up for grabs and can be bought and sold is misinformed. Instead, the user chooses what services he/she wants to receive, in exchange for their attention information. 

To help message these ideas and to protect consumers, Steve Gillmor and Seth Goldstein founded an organization called [[Attention Trust]]."
(http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/attention_economy_overview.php)

==Characteristics==

The healthy development of an attention economy requires that individuals take control of their own [[Attention Data]], argues Chris Saad, who warns for a Google monopoly:

"Economy implies that something (property) has value (in this case your Attention Data and Attention Profile). It also implies that you can transfer your property (and its value). You can sell it and leveraged and do all sorts of fancy things. It also requires multiple participants in an ecosystem."

Therefore, we need a set of principles that define the rules of the attention economy, expressed as basic consumer rights by the [[Attention Trust]] project:
 
* Property: You own your attention and can store it wherever you wish. You have CONTROL.
* Mobility: You can securely move your attention wherever you want, whenever you want to. You have the ability to TRANSFER your attention.
* Economy: You can pay attention to whomever you wish and receive value in return. Your attention has WORTH.
* Transparency: You can see exactly how your attention is being used.

===[[Criteria for Analyzing the Governance of Attention in Online Communities]]===

Ronen Tamari et al.:

'''On: Heuristics for attention in governance'''

"To augment existing literature on the governance of commons and online communities, and drawing on the preceding case studies, we propose the following heuristics for the analysis and design of attention economies as mediated by governance surfaces. The heuristics consist of five questions that researchers and
designers might ask about the flows of attention around governance surfaces.
We expect that designers will have to make context-sensitive tradeoffs among
the considerations that these heuristics raise; researchers will inevitably choose
to focus on some and not others.


====Modes: What kinds of activities require attention for the governance of the organisation?==== 

Modes of attention refer to the various kinds of participation the system requires for its governance. In each of the case studies,
organisations require participants to invest attention in reviewing proposals that
could be approved by a member vote; DAOstack, for instance, encourages a division of labour between attention for sorting through many proposals and attention for voting on them. Any kind of attention can also vary by degree—that
is, quantity or intensity. The degree of attention can be characterised in economic terms as the attention cost. The degree of attention a particular type of participation requires further depends on a participant’s experience or training;
proposal review might require less attention from an experienced participant
than from a novice. In general, different actors will have differing preferences
and competencies with respect to different modes of participation.


====Processes: What organisational and technical processes manage attention around the governance of the system?====

A combination of processes mediate attention across governance surfaces. These processes arise
through organisational structure, such as hierarchies of authority and social
norms, as well as technical systems, such as communications interfaces and
decision-making methods. While the role of attention is often implicit, in each
of the case studies, participants seek to explicitly redirect attention through
software automation. The cases also show how organisational and technical
processes mutually shape and constrain each other; for example, voting delegation, as in GitcoinDAO, is influenced by distributions of social capital among members. This process does not, however, attempt to make that distribution
representative demographically, geographically, or in terms of various skill-sets.

Processes that distribute attention raise questions of fairness and justice.


====Information: What information is available to participants, and how does it affect the expectations placed on their attention?==== 

Informed participation in governance requires knowledge that lies beyond any one participant’s purview. Depending on the organisation, information relevant for governance may come in large or small quantities, and it may be available in
ways that are highly accessible or that require considerable labour for interpretation. A highly transparent organisation might provide extensive information, which however incurs high attention costs for participants to examine and interpret; as Beller put it, ‘to look is to labour’ (Beller, 1994). An AI-aided governance system, conversely, may require lower attention costs to access information, but the assumptions underlying the AI may be inaccessible to users.

The legibility of information is thus an important variable in the attention economics of a governance surface. Choices about disclosure are also value-laden.

The GitcoinDAO scorecard system makes certain information accessible in order
to ease decision-making but introduces assumptions regarding what to measure
and how to measure it.


====Incentives: What are the costs and benefits for various participants to invest attention in governance?====

Organisations often seek to incentivise
participants to incur attention costs willingly. The incentives for governance
participation can take diverse forms—not only personal benefits but also collective benefits to the organisation or a broader community. 

For example, hosting a community gathering to discuss a contentious issue may result in high personal
cost and low personal benefit while being highly valuable to the community.
DAOstack, in contrast, aimed to incentivise attention through individual financial benefit. Characterising attention costs and benefits naturally invites a consideration of the ratio between them—a return on attention. When participants perceive a high return on attention, communities will presumably attract
active involvement in governance. Attention from others can itself be an incentive for participation (Srinivasan, 2023). Conversely, communities will have trouble attracting participation if the return on attention is perceived to be low.
It is important to be wary of high expectations of attention from groups who
do not experience commensurate benefit from their contributions, as feminist
scholarship has long taught (Nagbot, 2016).


====Feedback: How does attention to past outcomes influence future attention allocation and an organisation’s subsequent evolution?====

Human institutions are dynamical systems, meaning that their past outcomes become feedback that affect their future behavior. Thus, the analysis of attention economies requires a recognition of how they operate within an evolving institutional context. Participants allocate attention to governance with intent (or at
least preferences) to guide the evolution of the organisation. Systems scientist
Jay Forrester demonstrated that feedback mechanisms create unintuitive behaviors within social systems, but they are also tools that can assess and steer those systems toward intended outcomes (Forrester, 1971). A governance surface can
allocate attention to generate feedback for improving its own operations. This
is what leaders in GitcoinDAO discovered, and they adapted their governance
surface in several ways accordingly."

==History==

Nathan Schneider et al. review the research antecedents:

"Political scientist Herbert Simon is often credited with introducing the idea
of attention as an economy in a lecture on ‘Designing organisations for an
Information-Rich World’ (Simon, 1971). After a thought experiment on lettuce and rabbits, Simon proceeds with a basic summary:
in an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a
dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it
consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources
that might consume it.

From there Simon considers questions such as the costs of a corporate executive’s time and the attention-cost of reading a newspaper alongside its monetary subscription price. By imagining attention scarcity as a problem foremost for
leaders of organisations, Simon presents this scarcity as a matter of governance
from the outset. He contends that organisations should be designed around
information processing, so as to reduce ‘information overload’ with ‘a thoroughgoing application of price and market mechanisms’ (Simon, 1971).

As personal computers and multimedia applications proliferated, computer
scientist Mark Weiser was early to recognise their propensity to ‘grab attention’
from their users (Weiser, 1993). Weiser and colleagues at Xerox PARC proposed
to address this with interventions such as the concepts of ‘ubiquitous computing’
and ‘calm technology’, which sought to mitigate the demands of attention by
making devices more immersive or more peripheral, respectively, to their users
(Weiser, 1993; Weiser & Brown, 1995). Weiser and others thus recognised the
need to design technologies in ways that reflected an ethical orientation toward
users’ attention.

In 1997, physicist and consultant Michael H. Goldhaber popularised the term
‘attention economy’ during the early years of the World Wide Web (Goldhaber,
1997a, 1997b). Goldhaber expressed concerns about inequalities of access to
attention, as well as the abuses of power an attention economy could enable.
While Simon focused his concern with attention on the managerial elite, Goldhaber imagined its effects on the masses of current and future Internet users.

Attention became more evident as a concern in the age of computers, but
its importance didn’t begin there. A few years before Goldhaber’s work on the
subject, in the context of cinema, media scholar Jonathan L. Beller outlined an
‘attention theory of value’ (Beller, 1994), wedding attention economics to Marxian analysis as ‘the newest source of value production under capitalism today’ (Beller, 2006). The concept has attracted interest in a range of fields: for instance, anthropology (Pedersen, Albris, & Seaver, 2021), economics (Falkinger, 2007), law (Wu, 2017), literature (Lanham, 2006), and sociology (Franck, 2019).

‘Attention economy’ has meanwhile become popular business jargon in subcultures surrounding technology design and startups, referring to how attention can be captured and monetised (Davenport & Beck, 2001). In all of these contexts,
people have found value in recognising attention as a scarce and even calculable
resource, subject to flows of supply and demand.

Some scholars, however, have raised concerns about economising attention.
Perhaps the origins of their critiques can be found in Simon’s 1971 lecture,
in which he asserts a view that ‘human beings, like contemporary computers,
are essentially serial devices’ (Simon, 1971)—that is, machines that process
information one bit at a time. While this may be a useful approximation,
human attention involves social and psychological dynamics that the metaphor
does not reflect. For instance, cultural theorist Tiziana Terranova (Terranova,
2012) resists a mechanistic view of attention in favor of one more attuned to the
intersubjectivity of social experience. ‘Theories of the attention economy’, she
writes, appear locked within the limits of scarcity, unable to account for
the powers of invention of networked subjectivities, falling back into
‘herd-like’ models of connected sociality, and delegating to speculative mechanisms of financialization the capacity to create value out
of partial attention and continuous distraction.

Terranova’s concern about ‘the limits of scarcity’ reflects a broader concern of
feminist thought about the over-identification of economics with competition
over scarce resources (Bucher, 2012), rather than recognising the possibilities
that can emerge through cooperation. Attention can be scarce individually but
surprisingly abundant when organised collectively. For instance, crowdsourced
volunteer attention on platforms like Wikipedia can outperform encyclopedias
written by paid experts. Yet the gendered disparities in who edits and appears
on Wikipedia is a reminder that abundance has limits, too, and collective attention will not necessarily produce equity without intentional design (Shaw &Hargittai, 2018).

Feminist thought additionally invites consideration of the invisibilised labour
in attention economies. Women have often faced expectations of working in
ways that the dominant economy regards as less valuable or significant than
the work that men do (Nagbot, 2016). If ‘to look is to labour’, as Beller suggests (Beller, 1994), then attention economies risk subjugating certain sorts of attention-labour along lines of gender, race, and other received hierarchies. At
one extreme, marginalised groups may be systematically excluded from governance and, at the other extreme, their attention to governance may be inadequately respected or compensated.

The design of attention infrastructure thus has moral import, both for users
and designers. Georgi Gardiner has argued, for instance, that there are virtues
and vices associated with attention allocation among individuals and groups
(Gardiner, 2022). Seth Lazar further articulates ‘the distribution of attention’
in online contexts as a matter of ‘communicative justice’ (Lazar, 2023); evaluating questions of justice, Lazar argues, requires greater clarity than is typically available about how online systems distribute both the burdens and benefits of attention."

==Discussion==

===What needs to be done to achieve standards for the attention economy===

[[File:Attention_economy.png|thumb|right|400px|Attention Arquitecture]]

"Despite a large number of issues and substantial complexity, the Attention Economy is coming. The economics of the web and information explosion are driving us towards it. Understanding the issues and laying down correct principles and technology are important, to ensure this future marketplace is healthy. Here are some of the important issues that need to be addressed:
    
* '''Silos''': User information needs to be freed from proprietary silos
* '''Round Table''': The industry needs to create a round table, to enable organizations to govern both the business and technical aspects of the attention economy (think Java Community Process).
* '''Education''': People need to be educated about the value of their attention and the principles of attention economy. Avoiding privacy concerns will not work, instead they need to be tackled head on.

These challenges are far from trivial and will take time to resolve. Particularly, an industry round table is critical in order to expedite creation of standards and infrastructure for attention. The initiatives in several large web companies are on the way, but nothing has been formally announced. Also, a lot of smaller companies are well on the way to building attention services. They do not yet plug into a marketplace, but they will once the appropriate body of standards emerges."

===Michael Goldhaber on the Attention Economy===

Michael Goldhaber on '''how the Attention Economy differs from the Money Economy''':

"A point may be reached where money as currency is simply no longer necessary. It would do no more than duplicate attention flows that occur anyway, as easily extended via the Internet, search engines, etc. We can think of everyone having on average some attention from perhaps a couple of thousand people. Then everyone on earth — all six or seven billion people might be connected by no more than three or four degrees of separation. It will then behoove one to pay attention to the needs of almost anyone encountered, according to the stardom or connection to stars that person has. To put it most succinctly money is narrow band, but attention is wide band. In a world with plenty of bandwidth, the narrow band simply will get far less attention than now. Material goods production will also bring less attention to the producers, but still some, and it is through that that they will remain part of the new economy.

Why should this matter? A major reason is that as the standardized unit known as the dollar (or pound Sterling or Euro, etc.) increasingly ceases to represent standardized products but instead tracks attention, many of the effects of chasing after money and valuing some sheer number of its units becomes perverse. We have already entered what might be called the “dream–life of money," — and of large corporations and perhaps other large institutions, including universities, as well. Corporations become stages for the performance of their top executives, especially, and viewing themselves as stars they increasingly think it appropriate to accept increasingly large salaries and other perks, regardless of the “performance" of the company, or rather its shares. It is already accepted that a corporation exists only to “enhance shareholder value" but for the ordinary shareholder it doesn’t even do that, and money tends to be bled off the stock market anyway for the benefit of large hedge funds, their often superrich investors, and their extremely handsomely paid principals, who of course then simply have more to invest.

Meanwhile, what might be termed the “half–life" of typical medium–to–large–size firms continues to shrink. By half–life I mean the median period during which a firm has a fairly stable identity, clear purpose, core of personnel, specific relations to a certain set of consumers and of geographic communities, etc. Firms merge, split, go bankrupt, change course, change name (re–brand), change employees, and change outlook or focus at an apparently accelerating clip. Once, typical large firms showed remarkable stability, remaining much the same for longer than a human life. But as the half–life continues to shrink, at some point firms become insignificant epiphenomena, less stable and important in most lives than the kinds of open access projects and communities under discussion, and less attention–getting than the imaginative people behind them or operating in them.

How such people have been operating within firms has been changing in other ways. Often work is now parceled out to relatively short–lived “teams," who engage in specified projects and generally have one or a few stars at their core. Thus they much resemble entourages or open source projects. Quite often, even today, core members of these entourages reunite in different firms with different motives later on.

Partly out of self–defense, partly out of sheer attention–seeking zeal, a wider and wider range of social inventions will emerge, I suspect, to replace what firms and probably many non–profit institutions as well have really contributed. New forms of open source projects will be invented with different kinds of focus. Just as the Linux project does not much resemble Microsoft, even though Linus Torvalds competes with Bill Gates for attention, an open source transportation project might compete successfully with General Motors, Toyota or current airlines without necessarily resembling them, having factories, making cars or selling seat–miles.

It is easy to imagine communities or projects that focus on offering user–friendly open source “front–ends" or interfaces for different kinds of software, even though these mostly do not exist yet. It is equally easy to conjure up, say, an open source automobile–design project, which, unconstrained by patent restrictions comes up with highly superior cars. Likewise, the production process design might itself be open source, along with that of specific needed machinery. Finally, the process of successive partial automating of unwanted routine tasks could itself be open source.

One reason open source and corporate models are sure to clash is the issue of intellectual property. There are few large corporations today that would be profitable without patent, copyright and trademark exclusivity. Yet these are basically inimical to the Attention Economy, as they impose barriers of some sort to either paying or seeking attention, as I indicated above. Various speakers at the First Monday Conference offered salient examples. A well known case was that of Napster, in its original form. Drug patents are another case in point; they actual prevent some of the most promising efforts to develop new combinations of drugs; they encourage research to extend an existing cash cow rather than to develop truly beneficial new drugs; and, they are used mainly to feed profit flows to shareholders. The truly expensive part of drug research — namely clinical trials — seem well suited for replacement by an open model.

Non–profits such as universities, and even governments will play decidedly different roles in the full–fledged Attention Economy than they do now. University administrations in particular have viewed their functions in relation to the money economy, increasingly seeing their role as preparing students for careers, while fostering research increasingly to aid in the development of intellectual property. Some of the faculty and probably a majority of students have more or less the same outlook. Still, at the same time, both students and faculty continue to be eager adopters of new attention–economic forms that involve one or more kinds of openness. Most of these extend beyond the well–defined physical confines of the individual campus. They involve forms that clash to some degree with relatively long–held aspects of academic tradition ranging from distinct faculties and departments, careful credentialing and offering of academic credit, slowly changing curricula, central libraries, the importance of appearing “on campus", etc."

Text of an interview with Michel Bauwens, conducted by email on March 30, 2006:

"'''1)''' My educational background is in theoretical particle physics. The threat of nuclear war and the Vietnam war both made me aware that scientists had a responsibility to understand the wider world in which their discoveries were being used and how, and to act for what they understand as the good of all. Aside from some direct political work, I began to be interested in how the history of science fitted into socio-cultural  and economic history. By chance I decided to test my understanding with the relatively short history of microprocessors.   This was around 1980, as the personal computer was just taking off, when there was much talk of the "paperless office" and so on. 

If we were entering  a "post-industrial" economy, I wondered what was motivating it. That led me to think in terms of an economy based on information rather than things. But that formulation continued to trouble me. Economies are supposedly organized around the allocation of what is scarce, but even then it was completely evident we were wallowing in information. It was far less scarce even than the super-abundant consumer goods of the old material economy. The need for more information just doesn't work as a motivating factor. I began to be aware that what is intrinsically scarce yet highly desired is attention. What is the point of putting forth information if it doesn't garner attention?

There were all sorts of things to learn to make sense of this, and that is why it has taken so long for me to develop the idea fully. 

'''2)''' Since 1985, I have been talking and writing about what I first called the attention society, and then the attention economy. The difficulty in getting this idea across has to do with how people respond to the word "economy." Most people assume the word economy has to do with buying and selling, with exchanging money for things or labor, and exchanging things or labor for money, along with the profit motivation, and so on. 

But I mean economy in a wider sense: the network of exchanges of scarce entities that bind an entire society or several societies tightly together.  Around the year 1000, in Western Europe, for instance, that was the economy of knightly loyalty and feoffs. Markets as we know them were largely irrelevant; so was money. what mattered were security, and also loyalty, marriages, and success in battle, which ultimately depended on having enough loyal knights. Peasants grew crops, and made things, such as clothing and furniture for their families, but not enough to bind the larger society together. Only the economy involving knights did that, and, to repeat, even it wasn't market or money-based.  

Entirely through forces within Western European culture (including areas to which it expanded, such as North America ) the knightly, feudal economy eventually gave way to what is known as industrial capitalism, or as I prefer to refer to it the market-money-industrial based economy, or MMI. It wasn't that feudalism failed, but rather that it succeeded in meeting its ultimate goal of bringing  about security. The system created certain openings — certain possibilities that its own terms there was no way to fill. For instance, knights, who rode on horseback into battle, had to practice their maneuvers or  similar skills constantly. So they pretty much had to live in the country, not the city. In fact, during the height of feudalism, very few large towns and cities could be found in Western Europe. With some security of travel, cities sprang into existence as relatively free spaces. Out of that the MMI was born, in a process that extended over centuries. (The natural pace of change was very slow in those days, but is obviously much faster now, so a new kind of economy can become dominant much faster.)

In the attention economy the major kind of transaction is the passing of attention from one person to another. Because attention is intrinsically scarce, and also highly desirable, the competition for attention tends to create a spiral of ever greater strength, that is more and more intense competition, in as many different forms as anyone can dream up. Whereas the industrial system is predicated on standardized, uniform goods — including standardized, uniform money —as well as repetitive and uniform industrial work — where someone can keep doing exactly the same tasks over and over day after day, year after year, for an entire working life — in the attention economy, what counts is difference, relative uniqueness, originality, self-expression, personality, etc. 

There are basically two classes: those who receive considerably more attention than they give —or stars, in a very generalized sense; and those who pay out more attention than they get — or fans. Attention is remembered, so the new kind of wealth is not to be found in banks or material goods or stock ownership, but rather in the  minds of one's fans.  And so on.

As far  as I am aware, this idea of an entirely new sort of economy remains solely my contribution —others who may use similar language mean only that corralling attention is a way to make money, which is very far from my basic point. If the attention  economy in my sense comes to dominance, eventually money will have no meaning. One way to think about this: monetary wealth, — in essence a single number — is extremely narrow-band; attention as wealth — dependent on many aspects of person's characteristics and expressions — is extremely wideband; in a wideband world, the narrow band money is a tiny, irrelevant detail. 

'''3)''' Reed's law, as I understand it is a purely mathematical assertion about groups in networks.  It in no way removes the value of having lots of attention. The larger the group, the more the people in the group can focus lots of their attention on just a few stars. Then, being a large audience, they make those stars more visible to others outside the group. It simply provides a mechanism by which networking allows the attention economy to operate. True, there may be a very large —though not infinite — number of niches, so that there are now a very large number of websites and blogs, etc. But that doesn't mean they each get equal attention. Quite the contrary. 

The problem is that people do not generally want to spread their individual attention equally; they much prefer to give it to those who have already gotten their own or others' prior attention. That leads to attention inequality, which in turn leads to heightened competition for attention. Being a star, hard though it is, comes to seem ever-more desirable. The only way to change this would be for people, individually, and on principle, to decide to give their attention equally to everyone they notice at all, no matter how relatively interesting, entertaining, glamorous or boring each person happens to be. That isn't going to be easy.

'''4)''' In principle, I am very much for human equality and valuing every person equally. That's why in principle I favor some kind of socialism, which entails an equal division of important kinds of wealth, very much including attention. But, like everyone else I know, I find it hard in practice to pay equal attention to everyone, for the reasons just stated. It takes an incredible degree of self-discipline.  If we could devise means for each person to express themselves in ways equally interesting to all others, then we might have what might be called "attention socialism." I encourage everyone to work towards that ideal. In all probability, the efforts will be imperfect, but they might well help flatten the differences between stars and fans, or , in other words,  they might eliminate some of  the inequalities inherent in the attention economy.

As what I 've just said perhaps  suggests, I believe that we can only build  a better future by being  as realistic as possible about developing trends. I don't particularly favor the attention economy as much as see it as what's coming — and  hard to avoid. In some respects, though, I definitely do favor it over the continuation of an outworn and probably increasingly oppressive capitalism. But it is no utopia, by any means. We must be clear-eyed about that, as well. 

As a socialist by inclination, I am very aware that  Karl Marx still dominates much of the thinking of all parts of the political spectrum, in that he led people to believe that capitalism could only evolve one way — into socialism. Today that presumption is mostly interpreted to mean that since attempts at socialism haven't worked, capitalism is "the end of history." But Marx simply could not foresee the possiblity of the attention economy. It turns out capitalism, like feudalism before it, can give way to an entirely different kind of system — still a class system, with stars and fans replacing owners and workers. (By the way, to me capitalism and socialism are different versions of what I call the MMI economy.)"

(email interview with Michel Bauwens, on March 30, 2006)

=== Attention and online commons ===

Nelsie Kabben et al. :

"Online platforms have frequently been characterised as commons in the spirit of
Elinor Ostrom and her school of ‘Institutional Analysis and Design’ (Benkler,
2006; Murtazashvili, Murtazashvili, Weiss, & Madison, 2022; Rozas, TenorioForn´es, & Hassan, 2021). While Ostrom studied pre-digital communities and physical resources such as fisheries and water sources, networked information
technologies have since dramatically changed the nature of both the common
resources as well as the communities governing them. Later research focused
on digital communities and more abstract resources like knowledge (Hess & Ostrom, 2006).

Building on Ostrom’s legacy, Yochai Benkler introduced the concept of
‘commons-based peer-production’ to describe how large numbers of people work
collaboratively on public goods over the Internet (Benkler, 2002, 2006). In his
initial formulation of the concept, he equated attention in online communities with the fundamental flows of business economics. ‘The human attention required’ in collaborative communities, he wrote, ‘are the equivalent for peer
production of organization/decision costs in firms and of transaction costs in
markets’ (Benkler, 2002). Benkler focuses on the attention economies of discourse and contribution, but he does not similarly probe the role of attention in governance. Generally, Benkler envisioned increasing returns to scale for
the number of communities, projects, and resources available (Benkler & Nissenbaum, 2006).

Yet Benkler also recognised, in the first formulation of commons-based peer
production, that ‘adding agents increases the coordination and communication
costs’ (Benkler, 2002). More recently, institutional economist Eric Alston has
argued that such increases in organisational scale are precisely those which
drive the necessity of more complex institutions to regulate participant activities (Alston, 2022). Centrally managed platforms emerged, at least in part, to administer the organisational complexity required for managing digital spaces.

For-profit platforms represent a particular type of solution for how to alleviate attention overload in communities as they grow in scale and diversity—by enabling users to largely outsource their governance duties and attention management to the platform, at the cost of degrading user agency and autonomy.

Legal scholar Tim Wu coined the term ‘tyranny of convenience’ to describe the
tendency for ease-of-use to prevail over other concerns such as privacy and accountability: ‘Created to free us, [convenience] can become a constraint on what we are willing to do, and thus in a subtle way it can enslave us’ (Wu, 2018).

A wide-ranging taxonomy of online participation identifies attention as constitutive of any participatory community, while also observing that many users are unaware of the value of their attention investment (Fish, Murillo, Nguyen,
Panofsky, & Kelty, 2011). Achieving more equitable and sustainable commons,
it seems, will require more carefully accounting for the flows of attention."

===Key Books to Read===

*The [[Economics of Attention]]. By Richard Lanham. University of Chicago Press, 2006

*Related book: "Tom Davenport wrote a book with John C. Beck in 2001 called '''The Attention Economy: Understanding the New Currency of Business'''. While providing very interesting perspectives, the book focused much more on management techniques rather than taking on the task of mapping out a more systematic view of attention economics."
