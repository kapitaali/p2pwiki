Peter Limberger:

"Archeofuturism ... was coined by the “French New Right” thinker Guillaume Faye in his 1998 book Archeofuturism: European Visions of the Post-Catastrophic Age. Faye proposed a synthesis of “archeo” (meaning “beginning” or “founding impulse”), which entails tradition but not one disconnected from the archaic, with a futurist vision of progress. Such futures, he argued, require a sense of the sacred and must be rooted in the core foundations of Western European civilization.

Similar to [[Solarpunk]], the focus is on advanced technology, yet its core value is the sacred, with the aim of a return (or RETͶRN) to a true tradition. Additionally, it is associated with a “based” Identitarianism: not only an embrace of ethnic identities, but also a spiritual connection with ancestry and homeland, communing together within a hierarchical order.

Faye ultimately advocated a European pagan renaissance, yet he envisioned an alliance between neo-pagans and European Christians in order to bring about archeofuturism. Given this, I see the recently built Main Cathedral of the Russian Armed Forces in Moscow Oblast as having proto-archeofuturistic vibes.

Solarpunk and archeofuturism timelines see exponential technological advancement as inevitable, but the former harnesses it with the core value of nature, while the latter does so with the sacred."
