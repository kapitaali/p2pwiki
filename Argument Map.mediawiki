An argument map is a visual representation of the structure of an argument in informal logic. It includes the components of an argument such as a main contention, premises, co-premises, objections, rebuttals and lemmas. Typically an argument map is a “box and arrow” diagram with boxes corresponding to propositions and arrows corresponding to relationships such as evidential support. Argument mapping is often designed to support deliberation over issues, ideas and arguments in Wicked problems.

Argument Maps are often used in the teaching of reasoning and critical thinking, and can support the analysis of pros and cons when deliberating over [[wikipedia:wicked problem|wicked problem]]s.

Argument maps have been applied in many areas, but foremost in educational, academic and business settings. It has also been proposed that argument mapping has a great potential to evolve how we understand and execute democracy, in reference to the ongoing evolution of [[E-Democracy Webcasts Directory|e-democracy]].
