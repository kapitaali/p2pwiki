"3D scanning could be a way to solve the most difficult challenge in personal fabrication, dealing with difficult to learn CAD systems. These machines work like 2d scanners, take in data from 3D surfaces and convert them to data that can be manipulated in most 3D CAD packages. They still require significant training, but they help simplify the process for those that don’t have 2000 hours to master Solidworks or Pro-E."
