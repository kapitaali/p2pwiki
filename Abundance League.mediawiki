=Description=

"The [[Abundance]] League is a grassroots collaboration network of social innovators. Local chapter leaders host monthly salons that offer networking, guest speakers, and discussion about social innovation at all scales, from the interpersonal to the global social enterprise.

Gatherings have featured talks about clothing swaps, compassionate communication, poetry slams, storytelling, social entrepreneurship, public media, community gardening, transformational group travel, and more. And we’ve showcased artists, poets and musicians that inspire generosity, collaboration, and service.

The Abundance League embodies the idea that by exercising our social creativity, we can help each other connect to our potential, create lives rich in satisfying experiences, and turn scarcity into abundance. Abundance League is a salon, solutions showcase, and a model for those who share this vision."
