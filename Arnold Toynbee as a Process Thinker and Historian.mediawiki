From the abstract

"It will serve us well, I think, to reconsider a thinker who thought long and hard about the rise and fall of civilizations in the past, Arnold Toynbee.  It will be the purpose of the present article to argue for the claim that Toynbee can be fruitfully seen as a process thinker who was specifically concerned  with  the  dramatic  changes  that  have  occurred  historically  to  various  civilizations  around  the  globe.    In  this  regard,  he  is  in  many  ways  a  philosopher  or  historian  of  civilization,  much  like  Alfred  North  Whitehead,  Henri  Bergson,  and  Teilhard de Chardin, all of whom are cited favorably by Toynbee.  He is also similar to the  process  philosopher  Charles  Hartshorne  in  this  regard.    I  will  claim  that  Toynbee  can  provide  valuable  insight  to  us  at  this  moment  in  history."
