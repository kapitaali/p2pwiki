"A project within the Stanford 100 Year Study on AI, The AI Index is an initiative to track, collate, distill and visualize data relating to artificial intelligence. 

It aspires to be a comprehensive resource of data and analysis for policymakers, researchers, executives, journalists and others to rapidly develop intuitions about the complex field of AI."

"The AI Index has been developed by a group of Stanford based thought leaders to provide a comprehensive baseline to the state of artificial intelligence. Named AI100, the index measures 18 independent vectors in academia, industry, open-source software and public sentiments towards that technology. Shoham, a key individual responsible for setting up of the index stated


"The goal of the AI Index is to provide a fact-based measuring stick against which we can chart progress and fuel a deeper conversation about the future of the field."

The inaugural version of the index makes some interesting findings. For instance, the number of AI-based startups has increased 14 fold since 2000, while investments in the space have surged six times. Student enrolments in introductory AI related courses have surged 45 times at Stanford during the same period."
