how alternative movements use the internet as a media


=Review=

" In his 2004 book, An Alternative Internet, Chris Atton undertakes two different, but related, theoretical discussions. The first describes '''how different alternative media outlets use the Internet to separate themselves from "the dominant, expected (and broadly accepted) ways of doing things".''' Through the exploration of five case studies, Atton deftly illustrates practical applications of academic theory about the Internet. Each chapter is relatively self-contained in this respect, as the alternative media outlets are themselves generally unrelated."
