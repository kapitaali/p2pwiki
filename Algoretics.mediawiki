Fabiano Incerti and Douglas Borges Candido:

"To ensure that AI contributes to peace and the common good, Pope Francis invited us to foster an “Algoretics” – an ethics of programming and the use of digital technologies. This involves incorporating values such as transparency, fairness and respect for privacy from the earliest stages of technological development. This includes building robust international regulation and promoting education that empowers individuals to use AI with discernment."

Fabiano Incerti and Douglas Borges Candido:

"It was taking into account this complex and challenging context, but also full of educational and human opportunities that Pope Francis points out to us, that PUCPR approved, on August 21, 2024, in its University Council, the Guidelines for the use of Artificial Intelligence – AI at PUCPR. They concern, above all, the institutional alignment for guiding ethical, responsible, intentional and conscious ways of using AI in the teaching and learning process and in research, thus seeking to mitigate risks to learning, cognitive development, academic honesty or others, that the reckless use of AI tools can bring. In addition, its objective is to provide support and assistance to teachers and students so that they can explore the potential that Artificial Intelligence tools make available.

This is PUCPR assuming its responsibility in the education of students prepared to build an environment in which Artificial Intelligence is at the service of building a better and fairer world for everyone."
