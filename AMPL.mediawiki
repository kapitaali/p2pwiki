=Description=


"is a price-stable but supply volatile cryptocurrency that targets the CPI-adjusted dollar. It is used as a unit of account and collateral asset.

The AMPL protocol automatically increases or decreases the quantity of tokens in user wallets — such that the price of AMPL reverts to 1 CPI-adjusted dollar.

AMPL greatly simplifies the creation of on-chain derivatives. Traditionally complex financial operations like tranching are now safe, transparent, and simple.

As a building block AMPL enables the denomination of stable on-chain contracts without any reliance on centralized custodians or buyers of last resort. This lends itself to use cases including on-chain lending, on-chain borrowing, the creation of on-chain derivatives, and the creation of collateral for a decentralized stablecoin."
