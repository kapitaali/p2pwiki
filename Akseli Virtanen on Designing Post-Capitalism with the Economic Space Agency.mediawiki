The Blockchain Socialist:

"For this week’s podcast I spoke to [[Akseli Virtanen]] (@econaut6), one of the founders of the [[Economic Space Agency]] (@ecospaceagency) (ECSA), an organization for exploring protocols for post-capitalist economic expression. Akseli previously founded the Robin Hood Cooperative Hedge Fund and has been referred as The Andy Warhol of Finance.

During the interview we talk about how ECSA is  exploring the creation of post-capitalist economic media through the creation of a new “economic grammar”, how the Left can co-opt financial jargon to imagine a post-capitalist future (like social derivatives), and the irony of using the work of Friedrich Hayek on economic calculation to show that capitalism sucks. If you’re a leftist interested in the blockchain space, it’s absolutely imperative that you keep up with the work of ECSA."
