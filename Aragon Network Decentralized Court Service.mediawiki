=Description=

"The Aragon Network (AN) will be the first DAO whose goal is to act as a digital jurisdiction that makes it extremely easy and friendly for organizations, entrepreneurs and investors to operate. The Aragon Network will let organizations opt-in to it and use the services it’ll provide. Moreover, it’ll provide a built-in governance system — by using the Aragon Network Token, ANT — so the organizations using it will decide which services are provided, their cost, and other parameters.
The first services we want to provide are automatic contract upgrades and a decentralized court service."
