=Description=

"The Alliance of Community Trainers offers knowledge, tools, and skills to individuals, organizations and communities to empower sustainable transformation.

Whether it be community or organizational development, problem solving or conflict resolution, consensus decision-making, facilitation, strategic campaigns, media and public speaking, alternative technology, nonviolent action and environmental sustainability, we support people starting where they are, learning their vision of what they want.

Solutions to current community problems lie within the communities themselves, when people obtain the information, training and skills needed to facilitate those solutions.

The Alliance of Community Trainers weaves together experiences in different movements, issues, geographic areas and people of different ages, genders, cultures and ethnicities when working with groups to help them best achieve the world and life they want."
