<big>[https://www.agorakit.org Agorakit] is web-based, open source organization tool for citizens collectives and similar projects. By creating collaborative groups, people can discuss topics, organize events, store files and keep everyone updated as needed.</big>

Agorakit is a forum, calendar, file manager, mapping tool and email notifier.

It is being used by several citizen initiative like "[https://participer.toutautrechose.be Tout autre chose]" and "[http://deelnemen.hartbovenhard.be Hart boven Hard]" in Belgium and elsewhere.

It is open source (GPL) and in active development. We are currently searching and evaluating various decision making ideas to integrate in the tool.

We are always seeking for help, feedback, and publicity to attract more help.

Development happens on [https://github.com/philippejadin/agorakit Github]
