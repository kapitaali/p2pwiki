“During the month of November, the AccessP2P Program will bring together a cohort of students for weekly lectures from local P2P experts. From Bitcoin to Scuttlebutt, from governance to smart contracts, the program will highlight a spectrum of P2P theories, concepts, and technologies. Lectures will be hosted by local projects and companies, giving the cohort the opportunity to grow their network within the Berlin P2P community.”
