transitioners in 2009. Since 2013 it’s a non profit association
based in Paris.

Its purpose is “revealing, attuning and sharing all forms of
wealth in the service of Life”.

Its piliars are Wealth actualisation, organic Governance,
integral Vision and serving Life.

Valeureux designs, engineers and spreads human and
technological cooperation processes, particularly through
games, awareness and subtile combinaison of fun &
profound. It proposes events, workshops, trainings, coaching,
consulting and publications in France, and abroad thanks to Community Forge partnership.
Focus is on wealth actualisation, as making them real, updated and empowering their potential. It covers
governance, complementary currencies, alternative indicators, colective intelligence and human
development."
