=Description=

"The purpose of the Australian Free Software Association is to:

* Connect people interested in free software issues

* Share knowledge and experience

* Support and encourage free software advocacy

* Work together on solving issues local to Australia

We are in no way in competition with existing GNU/Linux user groups or national organisations such as Linux Australia. We aim to fill a niche for people with specific interests in free software issues.

We share the values of the [[Free Software Foundation]] on the [[GNU Project]]. We're part of [[Libre Planet]], a network of free software groups all around the world."
