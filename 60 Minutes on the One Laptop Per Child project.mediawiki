Lesley Stahl Reports On The Dream And The Difficulties Of Getting A Computer To Every Child


=Description=

"Nicholas Negroponte, a professor at MIT, had a dream. In it every child on the planet had his own computer. In that way, he figured, children from the most impoverished places – from deserts and jungles and slums could become educated and part of the modern world. Poor kids would have new possibilities.

As correspondent Lesley Stahl reports, it was a big dream.

Negroponte thought he had a chance of actually seeing it happen if he could help invent a really inexpensive laptop.

So, two years ago he founded a non-profit organization called “[[One Laptop Per Child]].” He recruited a cadre of geeks and viola! The hundred dollar laptop, designed specifically for poor children, was born."
