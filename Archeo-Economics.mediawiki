Tadit Anderson:

" Archeo-economics is basically about learning how ancient cultures innovated and created an economic commons. Michael Hudson has some important research in the topic area. Chartalism in part begins from archeo economics. Right now the economics of the Ionian Renaissance (aka the golden age of Athens) is very interesting to me alongside the development of their sense and practice of democracy and economics."
