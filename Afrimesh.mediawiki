"The ability to easily create an IP network in rural areas, developing countries and disaster zones can significantly contribute to the ability of people to communicate with each other.

Afrimesh builds on top of the most excellent B.A.T.M.A.N. project to provide a simple management dashboard which enables network operators to create and sustain a resilient communications network with a minimum of fuss."
