“Dion Almaer's Being Open is Hard provides a great starting point for describing how all Dojo Foundation projects are "100-point" open source projects:


*	0 points: Say you are open 

*	10 points: Choose an OSI license (BSD, AFL, Apache, MIT, etc.) 

*20 points: Define the governance of the code. (Check) 

**	Does one company hold all of the cards? (No) 
**	Can others participate? (Yes) 
**	For code, who participates? (Committers and contributors) 
**	Can anyone patch? (Yes, with a CLA) 
**	Can you, and if so how do you become a committer? (Yes, follow instructions for contributing patches and getting involved) 
**	At the core: How are decisions made (In the Open) 

*	30 points: A reference implementation under an open source license (Check) 

*	40 points: Where does the IP stand? (Clean, open, with CLAs). Did you donate it to a foundation? (Yes) “
