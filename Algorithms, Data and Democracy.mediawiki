=Description=

"Controversies regarding the digitalization and datafication of democracy currently develop along two interrelated axes; algorithmic infrastructures intensify and polarize issues of public concern while algorithmic decision-making is detached from citizen scrutiny and deliberation. The ADD-project focuses on these sociotechnical dynamics in an effort to reconfigure the algorithmic organization of data and strengthen digital democracy."
