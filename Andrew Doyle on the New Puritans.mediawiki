Conversation with Bridget Phetasy:

"Andrew Doyle returns to discuss his latest book The New Puritans: How the Religion of Social Justice Captured the Western World. Andrew wrote the book for people who are confused by what's going on in the culture right now. He and Bridget have a riveting conversation about what actually happened during the Salem witch trials and how it can be applied to today's culture--how you might not get hanged but you could have your life ruined. They also cover why the gender ideology movement is one of the worst things that happened to the gay movement, how this progressive ideology is making us more racist, and authentic racists are starting to feel more emboldened, why there's a focus on race, gender, and sexuality, but not class, money, or poor people, why seeing the culture war as a left vs right thing is misleading, loss of trust in the media, and the sad truth that where they’ll burn books, they’ll burn people too."
