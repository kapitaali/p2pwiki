=Bio=

"Agnieszka Pokrywka (PL/FI) by education is a filmmaker, interaction designer, art critic and physicist. By practice she is a graphic designer, researcher and cultural organizer. By heart she is a multimedia explorer interested in participatory, collaborative and open source practices while digging into topics of fiction, unconventional storytelling and interactive, networked narratives. Her current activities are conducted mostly in connection with Helsinki based Pixelache, a transdisciplinary platform for experimental art, design, research and activism.

Any division of her capabilities, interests and creative periods according to known social representations is rather artificial."
