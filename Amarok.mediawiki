"According to the home page:

    
''Amarok is the music player for Linux and Unix with an intuitive interface. Amarok makes playing the music you love easier than ever before - and looks good doing it.''

Back in 2003, a developer named Mark Kretschmann (also known as markey) began growing dissatisfied with the XMMS media player. 

Apparently:

''it annoyed me that you had to press so many little buttons to do the most basic tasks. Like, loading a few files into the playlist required clicking 5 buttons.''

He started thinking about how cool it would be if someone merged the Midnight Commander interface with an XMMS backend. Since no one else seemed to be doing it, Kretschmann threw his own app together and called it amaroK, after the album by Mike Oldfield. Today, it’s been renamed to Amarok and is run by (as developer Max Howell put it) “whoever commits the most code”. Amarok has tons of backends, supports portable media players like iPods, supports plugins, and is currently included in the KDE project, a real mark of honor.

If you are a basic user who just wants to listen to music, Amarok probably isn’t for you. Products like JuK are much easier to use. But if you aren’t afraid of learning new things or are a power music listener, Amarok is definitely for you."<br />
