M. Schatten and M. Žugaj:

"Since organizations try to achieve more and more innovation, they realize that there is neither
time nor resources to take advantage of all opportunities creative minds can create. To keep their
innovative human resources, organizations create spin-out companies for them to undertake
entrepreneurship. These spin-outs eventually yield companies for themselves [40; pp. 1-3].

Ad hoc suprastructures are concepts that are built on top of existing organizational structures
and they emerge as a response to some problem or change in the immediate environment of
the organization [11; p. 119]. Ad hoc organizations are characterized by adaptability,
readiness, individual initiative, desire for experimentation, creativity, and outside growth and
support [41; p. 7]. They usually disappear when the environment problem is solved."
