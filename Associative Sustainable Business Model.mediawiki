"This study contributes to the growing literature of Sustainability Business Models (SBM) by introducing a new category coined as Associative Sustainability Business Models (ASBM). We theorize that this category encompasses
firms with innovative business models that rely on partnership, association and
collaboration to create value in the triple bottom line and address pressing sustainability challenges. Following an inductive research approach, we analyze four case studies of ASBM ventures in the chocolate industry. Our
findings reveal the emergence of two key theoretical constructs (firm location and
claimant identity) that help to identify differences across ASBM designs and lead to four different sub-categories of ASBM. In addition, drawing on the literature of Sustainable Business Models, we developtheoretical propositions that link our four subcategories of ASBM to the business case for sustainability. Therefore, we extend the literature on SBM by providing new insights on how business model innovations based on strong association and collaboration can generate solutions to social and environmental challenges."
