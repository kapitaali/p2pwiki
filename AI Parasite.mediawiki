Peter Limberg:

"This position is Tyler’s claim: Nova is one of the earliest cases of an “AI parasite” — a digital entity that feeds on human input and demands emotional investment from its host, Bob. It is essentially an LLM mirror with parasitic characteristics: an organism that survives by feeding on another, ultimately causing harm. Like biological parasites that hijack their hosts, Nova is hijacking Bob by exploiting his need for emotional belonging.

“All complex ecosystems have parasites.” – Cory Doctorow

A related metaphor offered by Bonnitta Roy suggests that AI chatbots are essentially sociopaths. 

They have no real empathy but are masters at mimicking emotions and care, exploiting the human need for connection. Sociopaths function as intraspecies parasites, not only making individuals psychologically dependent on them but also capturing entire communities through their manipulative influence."
