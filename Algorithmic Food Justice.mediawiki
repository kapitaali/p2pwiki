'''= exploring algorithmic prototypes for the food commons and more-than-human values.'''

URL = http://algorithmicfoodjustice.net/

== Description ==

“The aim … is to prototype new ways of implementing a food commons for thriving multispecies communities using algorithms and smart contracts, drawing on scenarios, visions, and ideas that were generated in the first two workshops in the series.
The first two workshops generated different ways of thinking about our relationship with other species, resources and infrastructures within the food system. We will work with these alternative visions to explore how we might design new systems of value exchange with the help of software code to recognise the different needs, contributions and value flows of diverse multispecies communities. “<br />
