Pat Conaty:

"The co-operative movement was interested in decentralisation. Stephen Yeo’s upcoming book, the [[Three Forms of Socialism]], talks about the three types – parliamentary socialism, the welfare state / NHS etc., and ‘associationalist’ socialism. This last one is working-class self-help organisations – for example, trades unions, mutual societies, co-operatives & friendly societies – all created by working-class people to provide for themselves when the market couldn’t give a tinker’s cuss about them."
