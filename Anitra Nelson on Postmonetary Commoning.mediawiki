"Anitra Nelson: Postmonetary Commoning – A World Based on Real Values:

Nelson presents her vision of a real value economy (humane and ecological values) beyond money, beyond the market and the state. In such an economy localised economies would be networked globally but remain substantially locally collectively sufficient. Production is primarily collective but also delegated to individuals through a participatory decision-making and volunteering process. Community members are active in production a number of hours or engage in piece-work according to the community plan — all within a commoning framework."
