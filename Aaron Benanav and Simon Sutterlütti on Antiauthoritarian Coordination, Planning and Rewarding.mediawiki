"Aaron Benanav & Simon Sutterlütti: Antiauthoritarian Communism – Coordination, Planning and the Question of Rewards
Benanav and Sutterlütti have both put forward models for decentralized communism: Commonism and Association Socialism. Here they compare and discuss their approaches, focusing on two sets of questions: 1. Does communism need a transitional phase with a reward for work and how does this affect communist society as a whole? 2. What is the concrete planning process? How does such a society achieve global commitment, e.g. on climate issues, and how does it prevent new power structures? Who owns the means of production and who distributes the products?"
