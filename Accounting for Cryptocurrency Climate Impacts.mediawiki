''The Crypto Climate Impact Accounting Framework is a first step to understanding how to account for emissions across the cryptocurrency value chain.''


=Description=

"The Framework was developed by Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute (CCRI) & South Pole
in consultation with PayPal's Blockchain, Crypto and Digital Currencies (BCDC) team and other climate and crypto experts.

As part of the framework release, South Pole and CCRI have jointly developed a methodology for crypto value chain stakeholders to allocate GHG emissions to their cryptocurrency-related activities.

The report introduces a holistic framework that allocates the GHG emissions of a cryptocurrency's network across the stakeholders along the value chain based on cryptocurrency-related holdings and transactions."
