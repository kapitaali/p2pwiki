=Description=

"Education is the process of acquiring knowledge, values, and skills that are conducive to a satisfying and meaningful life.

Self-Directed Education is education that derives from self-chosen activities and life experiences of the learner, whether or not those activities were deliberately chosen for the purpose of education.

Some of us are already choosing to practice self-directed education in our families and within our larger communities. We know, first hand, that self-directed education works beautifully when the conditions are provided to enable it.

We invite you to join us in building the Alliance for Self-Directed Education. Together, we can create a movement that will liberate children and empower them to take charge of their own education — the way nature intended."
