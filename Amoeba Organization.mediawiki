The amoeba organization of Kyocera Corporation:


"Another example of an amoeba organization can be found in the Japanese Kyocera
Corporation that reorganized its 50 divisions into 400 amoebas (Figure 1) [9]. Amoebas in this
company are self-organizing units that are responsible for their own business. Every amoeba
has its own finance and human resource management. Amoebae do business together in an
internal market environment, and are constantly in search for better customers. Depending on
the situation in the environment they can be divided into smaller units or integrated with
other amoebae [10; pp. 179-202].

The amoeba organization represents an organizational suprastructure [11; pp. 129-131] that is
founded upon autonomy, flexibility and self-management [12, p. 263]. One can also observe
that an amoeba organization does not exist by itself but is incorporated into
some type of hierarchical structure [12; p. 264] which implies its superstructural nature."
