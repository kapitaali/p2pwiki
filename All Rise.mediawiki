'''Book: All Rise: Somebodies, Nobodies, and the Politics of Dignity. Robert Fuller.'''


Sequel book to the author's earlier book on [[Rankism]], i.e.  [[Somebodies and Nobodies]]. 

"In All Rise, Fuller argues that rankism — abuse of the power inherent in rank — does serious damage to private relationships and public institutions. The book also explores how to design social institutions that will overcome rankism and protect human dignity while laying the foundation for a dignitarian culture."
