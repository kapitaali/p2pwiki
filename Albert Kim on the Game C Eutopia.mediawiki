=Description=

"Recognizing that the multiple crises we face globally are confronting us with the limits and blind spots of our present systems, structures, and paradigms, we are inviting people in this new series to offer their best visions for thriving, integrally healthy societies of the future -- "eutopias" or planetary wisdom civilizations.  How might we better organize and "dwell together"?  How might we better integrate with and even optimize our local and global ecologies?  What would an integral kosmopolis look like, and what will it take to get there?

In episode 13, ALBERT KIM discusses the dynamics of Game A civilizations, the strengths and weaknesses of the Game B counter move, and an integral-pluralistic approach he calls Game C.  Recognizing the dangers and limitations of identifying a single "good place" for all, he proposes instead that we work towards the realization of a multi-centered meta-eutopia.

Albert Kim is a veteran of New York-based tech startups, an entrepreneur, and the founder of Noetic Nomads. Launched in October 2020, Noetic Nomads is a pro-social network of radical thinkers and doers navigating the metacrisis in the course of co-creating a more beautiful future."
