''alias Art Brock''

== Bio ==
''(the following is from 2011:)''

I'm a software architect at the [http://geekgene.com/ Geek Gene] in Denver, Colorado who mostly focuses on creating community-building tools. One of the unique things about many of these tools is the creative use of targeted currencies (alternative currencies, complementary currencies, local currencies, reputation currencies, community currencies, incentives, metrics and measures) to encourage participation which is healthy for the community and discourage unhealthy forms of participation.

You might know me from some of my companies (past or present): New Currency Frontiers, MetaCurrency Project, Flowplace, Local Capital Summit, Lifeblood Design, Geek Gene, Mile High Business Alliance, Targeted Currencies Network, Dream Team Technologies, Artful Solutions or Artful Internet Solutions, The Foundation for Inventive Learning, or Alpine Valley School. Or from past schools or employers: Michigan State University, Principia, Kingsbury, Japhet, Hughes Aircraft, General Motors, Chrysler or Aerotek."
