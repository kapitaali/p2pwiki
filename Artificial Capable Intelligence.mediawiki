"Defining ACI – an intermediate point between AI and AGI: 

“Rather than get too distracted by questions of consciousness, then, we should refocus the entire debate around near-term capabilities and how they will evolve in the coming years [...] I think of this as ‘artificial capable intelligence’ (ACI), the point at which AI can achieve complex goals and tasks with minimal oversight. AI and AGI are both parts of the everyday discussion, but we need a concept encapsulating a middle layer in which the Modern Turing Test is achieved but before systems display runaway ‘superintelligence.’ ACI is shorthand for this point.”
