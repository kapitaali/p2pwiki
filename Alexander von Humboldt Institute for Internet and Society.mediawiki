=Description=

'The Research Agenda of the Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society emphasises the increasing interpenetration of digital network infrastructures and everyday life. It is our common goal to study the unique dynamics of innovation on the Internet as an interplay between socio-cultural, technical and legal norms without privileging any one of these sources of ordering. All of our research projects share an interdisciplinary approach linking backgrounds and expertise in various disciplines. To achieve this objective, most research projects span at least two research areas and are supervised by at least two research directors. Research projects at the HIIG generally focus on structural features and collective practices rather than on individual behaviour and situational contexts.

The research conducted by the HIIG is organised in four research areas:

    Internet and Media Regulation
    Internet Policy and Governance
    Internet-enabled Innovation
    Global Constitutionalism and the Internet "
