=Description=

"At The American Commons, we seek to heal the partisan divide and bring the culture war to an armistice. We are driven by a passion for the sanctity of human life, the necessity of social justice, our responsibility to care for the environment, and promotion of a more peaceful world.

While we have a diverse range of convictions, as members of the American Solidarity Party, we are united in our desire to seek the common good, on common ground, through common sense in the political realm. As an unofficial grassroots publication, the views and opinions expressed at The American Commons are not necessarily representative of the American Solidarity Party itself."
