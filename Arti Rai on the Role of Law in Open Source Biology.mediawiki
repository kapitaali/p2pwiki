=Description=

"Computation is transforming research in the biological sciences. While such research has historically emerged from individual labs that focus on discrete questions, it is increasingly borrowing from open and collaborative models prevalent in software and high-energy physics. Intellectual property law will play an important role in facilitating - or perhaps undermining - the emergence of these new models. This talk explored the role of law as well as the larger question of whether "open source" models are likely to advance social welfare. Professor Raiis a leading expert in patent law, law and the biopharmaceutical industry, and health care regulation."
