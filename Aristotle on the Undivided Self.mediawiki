From the Preface:

"Aristotle undertook a systematic investigation of perception, the
emotions, memory, desire, and action, developing his own account of
these phenomena and their interconnection. My aim is to gain a
philosophical understanding of his views and to examine how far they
withstand critical scrutiny.

Aristotle’s approach calls into question the way in which our, post-
Cartesian, mind–body problem [as an *effect* of PRINT Paradigm, aka
"modernity"] has been formulated. He was guided throughout by a
conception of the psychological and of the material that was rejected by
those who originally set up and subsequently sought to address our
problem. His views constitute an alternative to basic elements of our
conventional thinking about psychological phenomena and their place in a
material world. They offer, in effect, the resources to dissolve, rather
than solve, the mind–body problem we have inherited. Or so I shall argue
. . ."
