'''ALTERNATIVE ECONOMICS, ALTERNATIVE SOCIETIES'''. A project by Oliver Ressler


URL = http://republicart.net/disc/aeas/index.htm

"After the loss of a counter-model for capitalism - which socialism, in  its real, existing form had presented until its collapse - alternative  concepts for economic and social development face hard times at the  beginning of the twenty-first century. In the industrial nations,  broadly discussed are only those "alternatives" that do not question

the existing power relations of the capitalist system and  representative democracies. Other socio-economic approaches are labeled  utopian, devalued, and excluded from serious discussion if even  considered at all.

This edition of the republicart web journal presents transcriptions  from 13 videos from Oliver Ressler's thematic installation "Alternative  Economics, Alternative Societies" focusing on diverse concepts and  models for alternative economies and societies, which all share a  rejection of the capitalist system of rule."
