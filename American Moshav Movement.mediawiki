'''= Jewish communal living movement in the US''': "A guide to the earth-based, shtetl-positive Jewish communities spanning North America" [https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/the-american-moshav-movement]

MADISON MARGOLIN:

""For many within the Jewish world and beyond, I’ve noticed a renaissance of the “back to the land” movement, once popular in the 1970s among hippies and those otherwise disillusioned with capitalism and city life, who sought refuge in erstwhile rustic places like Northern California, where they could live sustainably off the land and off the grid, in harmony with nature. Today, I’m seeing renewed interest in this trend—something of a diasporic “moshav movement” inspired by rural communes or Israeli, land-based communities—now cropping up everywhere from California to the Northeast, and from Mexico all the way to England.

While it would be impossible to list the full scope of Jewish homesteads, farms, and intentional communities outside ha’aretz, there are some larger projects I’ve observed or come into contact with over the course of the last two years that have convinced me of a major new strand in the future of Jewish community, one that will far outlast the pandemic and its consequences."
