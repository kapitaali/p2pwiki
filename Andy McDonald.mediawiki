=Bio=

"Currently, I am a PhD Student / Research Assistant within the Centre for Advanced Textiles (CAT) at the Glasgow School of Art (GSA). Having been sponsored by IBM throughout my degree (over 20 months full-time experience), I graduated from the University of Strathclyde in 2005 with a MEng DiplMan in Manufacturing Sciences & Engineering (w/ Diploma in Management). My Masters Thesis involved the development of a business model that enabled the customisation of T-shirts using a Flash-based interface. Following this preliminary study, I was offered a 3-year Research Studentship at the GSA to pursue my research. My first paper - entitled “Making Craft Competitive: (re)Evolving the Creative Ecosystem” - was published in June 2007.  In October, I was awarded a full-time Doctoral Research Grant from the UK Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)."
