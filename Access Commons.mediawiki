Sam Rose:

"Access Commons" is our current place holder for access to data flows,
designs, networks, resources, anything that is a building block
towards basic survival. Plus, it addresses the encirclement of
concepts and resources which were never meant to have access blocked
off from (like atomics particles and compounds, genes, etc that
otherwise naturally flow and evolve freely within systems)."
