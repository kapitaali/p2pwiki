=Description=

"Art & The Commons is part of a larger coalition of individuals and affinity groups that are investigating ways in which art, culture, and art education can be understood and developed as a commons. Commoning also serves as a guard against private enclosures.

This website will serve as an explorative repository of our commoning initiative through information gathered from our workshops, notes and observances of things we find related to the theme, and discussions with individuals about their relationship to arts, culture, and society.

Currently we are in the middle of research and conducting workshops in various communities. Afterwards we reconvene and discuss ways to continue the initiative, and this usually means making slight adjustments based on feedback, research, location, time, and even current events.

Similarly you can attend an Arts & Labor or Making Worlds: Commons Coalition meeting and let them know you are interested in the Art & The Commons group. There is also a monthly Alternative Economies subgroup meeting."
