=Description=

"The Alternative Finance Festival (AFF) is a grassroots festival throughout the Netherlands which celebrates the financial alternatives that already exist and everyone who is working on financial change, from citizen co-ops to ethical banking, from local currencies to unconditional giving. On 15 September 2018 it has been 10 years (!) since the fall of the US bank Lehman Brothers. It was the start of the financial crisis and it cost governments billions trying to save the banks. Since several measures have been taken, but the financial sector has not fundamentally changed and we are happily moving on to a next crisis. ''On '''14, 15 and 16 September'''(2018) therefore, the Alternative Finance Festival takes place to show that not only things must and can be different, but that there are already many alternatives that are paving the way''!"
