=Description=

"The APA Funk was founded in december 2008 by profissionals and friends of the music style FUNK, tired of experiencing its discrimination without doing nothing. APA Funk seek to defend the rights of the funkeiros (artists) and stand up for the Funk culture - against prejudice and criminalization. The Association promotes debates and activities about funk and helps artists to emancipate. The APA Funk was one of the driving forces that led to the implementation of law "Lei Funk é Cultura" (Lei 5543/2009) which recognizes Funk as culture."
