"We, the members and supporters of the Android Developers Union, are fed up with the conditions of the Android Market. We are tired of being treated like sharecroppers on Google's digital plantation! We have compiled a list of seven demands which Google can implement to improve the Market. Implementing these demands will absolutely improve the working conditions for Android developers, thereby improving the Android ecosystem and giving a better experience to our customers.

       
If our demands are not met, we will move our applications to alternative marketplaces or the web, cease Android development in favor of other more open platforms, we will dissuade other developers from developing Android projects, and we will work tirelessly to counter any of Google's hypocritical claims about Openness in the media."
