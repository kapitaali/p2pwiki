Ivor Stodolsky et al.:

"The Arts Assembly is a reflexive model for cooperation in the creative field. It unites a diversity of actors in new formats based on participatory action through peer-to-peer platforms. 

Each AA is a self-constituted gathering with performative aspects and audience participation. It is not a meeting, simply a debate or an exchange of opinions. A whole AA is a closely timed and choreographed series of performative events.

...

A Chamber is sub-unit of an AA constituted by a group with a particular idea or approach to assembling. The AA at Manifesta 8 has two Chambers: The [[Valuation Chamber]] and The Round Chamber"
