Darren Sharp:

"How does a city actually go about the task of making its assets, resources
and infrastructure more amenable to sharing? This question is being addressed
through a forthcoming book to be published by Shareable that will provide
municipal governments and civic leaders with the best Sharing City models and
actionable policies available.

The Sharing Cities Network has inspired sharing advocates to self-organise in
cities the world over using asset mapping as a method to connect community
groups and sharing enterprises to local government and build support for crosssector collaboration.53 Asset mapping is an important first step towards creating
a Sharing City because it makes community assets more visible, helps convene
local stakeholders for community building and enterprise development, and
creates new opportunities for partnerships to emerge.

City governments have a major role to play in designing the infrastructure,
services and regulations that enable sharing in all its forms and strengthen
the urban commons through policies for Sharing Cities that support food, jobs,
housing and transportation initiatives to keep and grow wealth in local
communities."
