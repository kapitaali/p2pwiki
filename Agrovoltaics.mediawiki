This article shows that:

agrivoltaic systems work well with potatoes, certain grape varieties, hops, spinach, lettuce, field beans and legumes, as well as onion, cucumber and zucchini to a lesser extent. However, it does not work with wheat, corn, pumpkin, sunflower, broccoli or millet, as these crops tend to be more sunlight intensive.

Western Cape is the home of the South African wine industry and has a lot of vineyards which seem to have good potential for agrivoltaics, as shown in other use cases around the world:
