"Before teaching a course on virtual community and social media, I invite students to probe issues of attention, continuous partial attention, multitasking, raised by their media practices today—including WiFi in the classroom—by asking them to start paying attention to their attention."

"Attention 102: The view from the front of the classroom

The second in a series of probes into awakening a literacy of attention in classrooms & elsewhere: I shot professor’s-POV video of students staring at laptops, showed edited video to students at the next class meeting, then shot video of them watching—and not watching—themselves watching (and not watching) the professor (me).  Additional camera/editing: Stephanie Gerson."
