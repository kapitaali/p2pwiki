"The Alexandria Archive Institute (AAI) envisions an open, Internet-based knowledge commons of world cultural heritage. We are working to provide innovative digital services for sharing research, thus filling the gaps in traditional publication. To this end, we have created Open Context- a free, open access resource for the electronic publication of primary field research from archaeology and related disciplines."
