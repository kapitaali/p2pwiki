'''Designed to encourage the positive, caring side of human nature, Altruistic Economics assumes that people's wellbeing is related to that of their friends. Like classical economics, it assumes that people maximise their welfare. Unlike classical economics, everyone's well being is uniqely dependent on their sympathy for other specific individuals, so that our self-interest is counter-balanced with concern for the welfare of friends.'''
