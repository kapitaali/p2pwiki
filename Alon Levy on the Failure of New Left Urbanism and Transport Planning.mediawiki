"The New Left political culture of freeway revolts, local activism, veneration of urban small business, and focus on consumption rather than production has led to a bad urban compromise, which can be described as "to the pedestrian, city center; to the car, the world." This video goes over the origin of this failure, how it ensured cities would be dominated by cars outside the tourist ghettos, and what alternatives there are."
