Platform Co-op Showcase 10 - ReDI School of Digital Integration:

"(12 mins) Anne Kjær Riechert -- ReDI School of Digital Integration was founded in 2015 by a team convinced that technology can break down barriers and bring people together to build new solutions to old problems. The idea of ReDI was sparked by the insight that amongst the refugee population there are incredible talents eager to learn and eager to contribute, who could help fill the 43.000 open IT jobs in Germany. From the beginning, ReDI has been developed through co-creation between the Berlin tech community and the ReDI students. The aim is to provide students with valuable digital skills and a strong network of tech leaders, mentors and alumni to help create new opportunities for all. ReDI is a non-profit social enterprise offering several 3-months IT-programs, creative workshops, tech-talks, innovation projects as well as short term summer courses. ReDI has also helped to incubate 3 start-ups."
