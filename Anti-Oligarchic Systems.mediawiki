As main compiler and curator of this wiki, I hold on to the position that:

* any competitive dynamic around scare resource inevitably leads to oligarchic concentration of resources and powers, since each round of these iterative games creates stronger competitors who are stronger in the next iteration of the game (Game A dynamics).

* as long as we are in, sometimes inevitable Game A dynamics, it is therefore important to have anti-oligarchic protocols which rebalance the oligarchic distribution

* for example, the [[Quadratic Voting]] system sin Web3, give more weight to small token holders than big capital providers, creating more equilibrium in the system.
