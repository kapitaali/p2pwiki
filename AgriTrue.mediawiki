=Description=


"AgriTrue is a self-certification system for organic produce.

The certification is mostly based a full and frank disclosure of the methods used to produce the food. To accomplish this, the producer provides a page for their farm/garden that provides the details.

How to ID AgriTrue products? AgriTrue farmers will be able to put a barcode on their products. This barcode will provide access to info on the farmer's disclosure page."
