"In our ever-evolving world of consumption, we are learning that what really matters is the experience that a product delivers, not the ownership of that product. As Theodore Levitt said, "People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill, they want a quarter-inch hole."

Access Trumps Ownership, inspired by a quote from Kevin Kelly, delivers news and opinions on the emerging market of collaborative consumption, the access economy, and the shared economy."
