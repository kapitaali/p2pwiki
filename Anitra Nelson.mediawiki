"For many years Anitra Nelson lived in two communities where property was collectively owned and, in one, all the work and income was shared. At the same time she studied capitalist and non-capitalist structures, especially with respect to the power of money, writing her doctoral thesis and publishing a book on what Marx called 'the god of commodities'. A few years ago she initiated a work by ten contributors, which has brought together arguments for collective organisation of production and trade beyond money and, in effect, the transfer of all ownership and management to commons. '''Life Without Money: [[Building Fair and Sustainable Economies]]''' also provides real life examples of people who are showing that such a world is possible."
