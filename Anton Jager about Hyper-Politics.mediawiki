=Description=

"Jen Pan speaks with Anton Jäger about his new article on “hyper-politics”: while a constant, low-stakes political discourse suffuses everything now, very little improves. Jäger contrasts hyper-politics to both the post-politics of neoliberalism and the mass institutional politics of the traditional left. Hyper-politics has low-stakes for entry, participation, and exit. The result is a stream of fleeting, impermanent political moments that add up to very little. Jäger considers how we might move from hyper-politics back to the mass institutional working-class politics that saw real gains in the past."
