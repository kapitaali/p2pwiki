=Description=

"We recently did a panel discussion with panellists from organizations actively involved in open source including IBM, Redhat, Ingres, Eclipse, Mozilla, and i365, a Seagate company. 

The 3 pillar themes of the evenings panel were to be education, business, and government. The session was interactive and thus the potential to explore other areas. Greg Wilson asked why the data indicates that open source is multiple times less inclusive to women (than closed source/corporate development). This was based on some research by Greg and Michelle Levesque. See one of their papers - [http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~gvwilson/articles/open-source-cold-shoulder-2004.pdf Women in Software Open Source], Cold Shoulder.

Thus we had an unexpected and important discussion about open source inclusiveness - particularly towards women."
