=Description=

Stella Dawson:

'The Africa Development Bank (AfDB) in July completed its Open Data Platform, which links live data from national statistics offices, central banks and ministries in all African countries with users and international development organisations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

The platform will allow national, regional and international groups to track development progress on projects such as the Millenium Development Goals, agreed by the United Nations for reducing poverty and improving the quality of life worldwide. The platform allows users to look at different indicators over a set period of time, use templates to create visuals and share their work with others."
