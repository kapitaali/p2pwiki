"Spot Runner founder David Waxman, ViTrue CEO Reggie Bradford, and Slide CEO Max Levchin discuss the rise of advertising by the masses.  Spot Runner, for instance, democratizes the creation and distribution of TV commercials, while ViTrue helps brands recruit consumers to create their own ads.  And Levchin points out that, like it or not, there is going to be a lot more consumer-created content on the Web than professionally-produced content and brands are going to have to figure out how to advertise against it."
