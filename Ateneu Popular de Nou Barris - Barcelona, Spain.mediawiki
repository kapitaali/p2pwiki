"The Ateneu Popular de Nou Barris represents one of these historical cases. Founded in 1979 in a context of dictatorship, the Ateneu was an old factory occupied by citizens from the neighborhood claiming for social and cultural spaces in their area –one of the poorest of Barcelona. From then on, the Ateneu consolidated its own agenda and profile, and then it entered into a “legal agreement” with the City Council, being recognized as a citizens-managed centre from the very beginning of the 1980s."
