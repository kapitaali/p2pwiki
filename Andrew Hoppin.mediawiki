"Andrew Hoppin was appointed the first Chief Information Officer for the New York State Senate in February 2009. The CIO’s Office works in three main realms: opening up the Senate’s legislative and administrative data for public access (for transparency), overhauling the Senate’s internal communications and collaboration infrastructure (for efficiency), and launching new Web 2.0 / social media technologies for the Senate (public participation). Previously, Andrew co-founded the NASA CoLab program at NASA Ames Research Center, which increased efficiency and transparency at NASA by building new partnerships between NASA and external communities of practice such as the entrepreneurial technology community, the global open-source software movement, and constituents in the virtual world of “Second Life.”Andrew has also founded several startup technology companies and has served as a strategy consultant, Advisor, or Board member for Craigslist Foundation, Netroots Nation, the Space Generation Advisory Council and the New Organizing Institute."
