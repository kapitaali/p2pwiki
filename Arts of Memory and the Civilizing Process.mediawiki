John Sutton on 'The Arts of Memory and the Civilizing Process':

"The remarkable medieval and Renaissance memory practices have been richly described by such wonderfully interdisciplinary modern scholars as Frances Yates and Mary Carruthers, whose works should be consulted for historical detail of specific mnemonic practices and writings (Yates 1966; Carruthers 1990). Although the broad techniques in question have survived from the ancient world to the present and are still studied in contemporary applied cognitive psychology (Moe and de Beni 200S), we can find in their heyday an intriguing case study in how cognitive artifacts were internalized in an alien moral, social, and theoretical context."
