=Description=

"Acts of Sharing is an new service for sharing items you own with your community. Taking inspiration from Acts 4:32 from the Bible, “all the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of his possessions was his own, but they shared everything they had”, the service takes a unique approach to item-sharing and was a community finalist at SXSW."
