"The Democracy Collaborative's new white paper "The Anchor Dashboard" helps hospitals and universities measure the impact of their programs, initiatives, and economic activity on the well-being of low-income children, families, and communities. Made possible by support from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, our report draws on over 75 in-depth interviews with leaders of anchor institutions, national nonprofit organizations, federal agencies, and community organizations. "
