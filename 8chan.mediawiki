Sal Hagen et al.:

"8chan, or infinitychan, is a currently-defunct imageboard, a webforum with subforums (“boards”) where anonymous users can create and participate in conversational “threads” through posting text, images, and links. Like other imageboards, it is ephemeral, meaning threads will be closed and deleted (or archived) after a certain amount of time. 8chan uses a version of the Yotsuba imageboard infrastructure, adding the ability for users to create their own boards, as well as providing robust overviews of user activity on the front page (image 1). Since imageboard code is usually open source, there are in fact many “chans”, like 2channel or Krautchan."
