I have a Master's degree in Science Communication and I am a member of the ICS group. My research interests are focused on communication in the field of biotechnology, in particular on science images and mediatic contemporary biotechnologists. Furthermore, I study the role of the ICT and the Web in this sector. I am an editor of JCOM (Journal of Science Communication), and as a freelance journalist I write about science and technology on several Italian newspapers and magazines. You can read more in my blog, Qwerty."
