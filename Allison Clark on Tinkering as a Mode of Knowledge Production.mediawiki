"The MacArthur Foundation brought together educators, "tinkerers," curators, artists, performers and "makers" to grapple with questions around ensuring that all students benefit from learning in ways that allow them to participate fully and creatively in public, community, and economic life.

These interviews from five of the participants were produced to provide some insights into the thoughtful and passionate conversations from that convening."
