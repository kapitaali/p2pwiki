=Description=

From the Wikipedia:

"Annodex is a digital media format developed by CSIRO to provide annotation and indexing of continuous media, such as audio and video. It is based on the [[Ogg]] container format, with an XML language called [[CMML]] ([[Continuous Media Markup Language]]) providing additional metadata. It is intended to create a [[Continuous Media Web]] ([[CMWeb]]), whereby continuous media can be manipulated in a similar manner to text media on the World Wide Web, including searching and dynamic arrangement of elements."
