=Description=

"Viewing architecture as narrative, commentary, event, and service, I am investigating an architecture of resistance which stands in opposition to the pervasive cultural forces of thoughtless consumption and the over branding of human life that have eroded experience of the physical world. I aim to expand the discourse of architecture through a critique of the profession in its current state and by employing the spirit and tactics of the culture jamming movement. Ultimately, my physical interventions will focus on the reclaiming of public space to promote a shift in consciousness through direct and participatory engagement and focus architecture on the act of service."
