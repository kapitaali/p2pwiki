"We are a nonprofit R&D lab building AI tools for coordination and deliberation
How can we use technology for socially beneficial outcomes and long-term resilience?

Our work explores the possibilities through research and experiments with novel AI capabilities — especially those not on the default path of for-profit ventures, including proof-of-concept prototypes and open-source tools."
