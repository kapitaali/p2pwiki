"Alexa is a regular commentator on topics related to economic transition, wisdom, disruptive innovation, black market and fringe economies, and technology angst. She is the co-author of The Misfit Economy (forthcoming with Simon & Schuster). She has written and appeared in Fast Company, Forbes, Wired, Dazed and Confused, VICE, Harvard Business Review, the New York Times, the Guardian and MTV. She is the founder of Wisdom Hackers. When not operating in the world as Alexa, you can find her playing the Amish Futurist, an alter ego bringing Socratic inquiry to the tech scene."
