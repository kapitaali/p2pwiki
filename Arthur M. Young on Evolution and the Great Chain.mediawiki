"Philosopher Arthur M. Young, inventor of the Bell helicopter, describes three different types of evolution: physical evolution of the form of the body, evolution of the "group soul" of a species, and personal evolution, i.e., your own spiritual evolution. This program contains excerpts from Arthur M. Young: The Reflexive Universe, a documentary about Young's life and work."
