"What paths lie ahead for religion and spirituality in the 21st Century? How might the insights of modernity and post-modernity impact and inform humanity's ancient wisdom traditions? How are we to enact, together, new spiritual visions – independently, or within our respective traditions – that can respond adequately to the challenges of our times?

In episode 32, Alexander Bard joins Bruce and Layman for an Apollonian overview of, and a Dionysian deep dive into, Syntheism and the Syntheist movement; the question of religion in the wake of Hegel and Nietzsche; the promise of a (post)metaphysical "God of the future"; the religious dimensions of Burning Man; the gifts of Peirce and Whitehead for process-relational theology; the richness of Zoroastrianism and the little-known links between Persian and Tantric traditions; the flowering of "digital monasteries" in our networked age; and much more.  At the end, Alexander turns the tables on us and asks us a bit about our own religious backgrounds and metaphysical projects as well.

Alexander Bard is a Swedish author, lecturer, artist, songwriter, music producer, TV personality, religious and political activist, and one of the founders of the Syntheist religious movement alongside his co-author Jan Söderqvist."
