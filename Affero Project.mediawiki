=Description=

"Affero combines a peer based reputation system with a commerce system. It enables individuals to rate other individuals and make payments on their behalf. The rating system could be compared to the karma system provided on slashdot, although all member have equal access to rate others. Basically, any person can rate another person's contribution.

Also, the system doesn't come bundled with any particular forum or community platform, so any independent community host can integrate the services and individuals can share reputation across various communities."
