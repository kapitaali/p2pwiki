= DFW Alliance of the Libertarian Left

=Description=

"The Alliance of the Libertarian Left is a multi-tendency, decentralized coalition of individualists, mutualists, agorists, voluntaryists, market anarchists, green libertarians, dialectical anarchists, voluntary socialists, radical minarchists, and others on the libertarian left, united by an opposition to statism and militarism, to cultural intolerance (including sexism, racism, and homophobia), and to the prevailing corporatist capitalism falsely called a free market. We’re organizing local activist groups to advance individual freedom, peace, and social solidarity in our communities, using the tools of education, nonviolent direct action, and cooperative counter-institutions — not petitions, party politics, or symbolic protests."
