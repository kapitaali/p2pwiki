=Description=

The Asset Transfer Unit ("ATU") helps to empower local people and organisations to transform land and buildings into vibrant community spaces whilst supporting the development of a thriving third sector. They provide advice, guidance, and support concerning the transfer of under-used land and buildings from the public sector to community ownership and management - helping organisations to develop those assets and deliver long-term social, economic and environmental benefits. 

The ATU is delivered by the [[Development Trust Association (UK)|Development Trusts Association]] in association with [http://www.communitymatters.org.uk/ Community Matters] and the [http://www.lga.gov.uk/lga/core/page.do?pageId=1 Local Government Association], and funded by [http://www.communities.gov.uk/corporate/ Communities and Local Government]."
