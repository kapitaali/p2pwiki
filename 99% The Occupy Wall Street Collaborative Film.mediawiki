=Description=

By Kelly McCartney

"A new collaborative film from co-directors Aaron Aites and Audrey Ewell, this project enlisted the help of 99 filmmakers from around the country in order to crowdsource footage for the piece. The result hits theaters on September 6. Critics who have seen the film in its entirety — at the Sundance Film Festival or elsewhere — walked away with mixed feelings. Among the reviews, Hollywood.com called 99% "a rousing call-to-arms, regardless of feelings on the economical and political issues."
