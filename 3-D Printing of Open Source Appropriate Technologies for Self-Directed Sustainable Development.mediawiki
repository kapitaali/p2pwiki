=Abstract=

"The technological evolution of the [[3D Printing|3-D printer]], widespread internet access and inexpensive computing has made a new means of [[open design]] capable of accelerating self-directed sustainable development. This study critically examines how open source 3-D printers, such as the [[RepRap]] and Fab@home, enable the use of designs in the [[public domain]] to fabricate [[open source appropriate technology]] (OSAT), which are easily and economically made from readily available resources by local communities to meet their needs.  The current capabilities of open source 3-D printers is reviewed and a new classification scheme is proposed for OSATs that are technically feasible and economically viable for production. Then, a methodology for quantifying the properties of  printed parts and a research trajectory is outlined to extend the existing technology to provide complete village-level fabrication of OSATs.  Finally, conclusions are drawn on the potential for open source 3-D printers to assist in driving sustainable development."
