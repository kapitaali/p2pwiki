Conference at http://www.rethink-music.com/


=Description=

"We sat down with two people who have been very involved in preparing for the event—Allen Bargfrede, a digital music lawyer and Assistant Professor in the Music Business Department at Berklee, and Chris Bavitz, Assistant Director of the Berkman Center’s Cyberlaw Clinic and Clinical Instructor and Lecturer on Law at Harvard Law School—to discuss what the Rethink Music Conference is all about.

This is just the first installment in our Rethinking Music podcast series, which will cover the entire spectrum of music and the music industry!"
