=Description=

"The Huffington Post is an incredible Web success story. In two years it's become a site with enormous traffic based upon the richness of its content. Is HuffingtonPost.com the future of news media? It's partisan, of course, but in many countries -- and even many American cities -- newspapers overtly take sides. More important from the point of view of the miscellaneous, the Huffington Post has an abundance of bloggers and commentators, representing a wide range of progressive interests, who provide an infrastructure of ideas, facts and opinions that adds context to any story. 

In this audio podcast (the third in a series sponsored by Wired News and the Harvard Berkman Center for Internet & Society) David Weinberger talks with Arianna Huffington -- a winner of a 2007 Rave Award from Wired -- about her site and how bloggers are reorganizing and reinventing the news."
