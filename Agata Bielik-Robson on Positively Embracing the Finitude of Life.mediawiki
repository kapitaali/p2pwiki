On 'messianic vitalism' as an alternative on Heidegger's vision of life as 'finitude before death'; against the 'thanatic civilization'.


=Description=

"Martin Heidegger (1889-1976) made the theme of finitude, human finitude, central to his philosophy: humans have ‘being towards death.’ In this video Prof. Agata Bielik-Robson challenges this and argues that rather than studying finitude under the auspices of death we should study human finitude under the auspices of life. We should engage with life now, living, rather than seeing life as ‘befre death’ or ‘before afterlife.’ "
