=Description=

"Presentation at Net Tuesday San Francisco on May 13, 2008 by Adam Frey, the co-founder of Wikispaces.

Wikispaces is a provider of easy to use and easy to adopt hosted wikis. Wikispaces provides public and private wikis for small groups, and private label wiki environments for organizations such as schools and nonprofits.

Prior to founding Wikispaces, Mr. Frey founded and managed the SourceForge line of business at VA Linux Systems (later VA Software). Frey holds a Bachelor of Science degree with Honors from Monash University and an MBA from Columbia Business School.

In his presentation, Adam emphasizes that ease of use and freedom to explore make wikis a good tool for collaboration. They are a tool that educators have found to be useful in working with students, and they may be a good tool for nonprofits as well."
