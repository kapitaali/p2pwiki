=Description=

"The ATU was established to promote and support community asset transfer. Put simply, '''[[Asset Transfer]] is a shift in management and/or ownership of land or buildings, from public bodies, (most commonly local authorities), to communities''', (community and voluntary sector groups, community enterprises, social enterprises, etc).

Community ownership and management of assets is not new. It has a well-documented history going back hundreds of years.

In recent years, the momentum behind community asset transfer has gathered pace with increasing recognition of the contribution it can make to the development of a strong and vibrant civil society."
