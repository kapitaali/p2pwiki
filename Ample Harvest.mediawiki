Lara Rabinovitch:

"The organization [[Ample Harvest]] [http://www.ampleharvest.org/] takes a different approach to making the most of abundance. With the goal of “No Food Left Behind,” this national organization aims to match gardeners overwhelmed by excess produce with hungry families in their communities. Last year AmpleHarvest.org facilitated the donation of more than 20 million pounds of fresh produce across the country. The organization combats hunger and, by providing fruits and vegetables, also works to alleviate obesity and increase the health of low-income Americans."
