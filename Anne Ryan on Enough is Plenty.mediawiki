"Anne B. Ryan is the author of Enough is Plenty which will appear later this year. She argued that the adoption of a new self-limiting worldview is as crucial as the adoption of new technologies. "We are all born with the capacity for enough and everybody has a part to play in the creation of a culture of enough, as a way to understand the world and to live in it," she says.

Recorded on day two of The New Emergency Conference: Managing Risk and Building Resilience in a Resource Constrained World. Held on 10-12 June 2009, All Hallows College, Drumcondra, Dublin 9, Ireland"
