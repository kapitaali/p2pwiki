Concept from Enrique Dussel, explained by Mark Burton:

"A key concept is that of the “analectic”, or “ana-dialectic”, in which Dussel claims to incorporate and transcend the Marxist dialectic which he sees as both negative and operating within the totality of the dominant world system.  “Ana”, meaning “beyond” refers to the peoples outside that totality who he sees as (actually or potentially) mounting both a negative critique (of the oppression of the system) and a positive critique that counterposes an alternative, utopian horizon, drawing on their alternative cultural heritages and world views."
