=Description=

"Until recently, The African Commons Project has been the host organisation for iCommons, a UK charity that has run three major international iSummits around sharing and collaboration in Rio de Janeiro, Dubrovnik and Sapporo.

Our aim is to turn communities into active participants in the digital economy and to defend, protect, support and encourage the freedom of South African societies to create, build upon and share knowledge. We aim to promote the highest levels of open access to intellectual products for organisations and individuals – especially those with a public mandate."
