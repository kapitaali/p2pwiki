In her PhD by Publication artist Susanne Bosch argues that my art practice serves as a useful contributor towards shaping elements for the activation of civil society. „Through consideration of three interrelated examples from my art practice from 1998-2011, which emerged from my Restpfennigaktion (Left-over Penny Campaign) an artistic methodology has emerged that shows links between the artwork as process and product in relation to notions of transformation. Lynn Froggett writes, “The transformative potential is realised when it generates a cultural form for experience that needs the visual or performative register for its fullest expression.“
