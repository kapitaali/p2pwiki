Giulio Quarta and Simone Robutti:

"Althea Network originated from Hawk Networks, a small company aiming to provide Internet access to unconnected communities in Oregon. Utilizing a mesh network system, the team allowed small groups to build, share and manage internet infrastructure collectively.

As their operations grew and more communities got connected, the project progressively evolved into a stack of different components, first running on [Gnosis Chain](https://www.gnosischain.com/) and then becoming its own independent blockchain, Althea Network Layer 1, live on mainnet [since April 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SusUaoL_gg).

Althea is now a decentralized protocol allowing communities to manage their own internet services, offering secure transactions and automatic compensation for bandwidth providers; the network ensures privacy with **encrypted connections and uses a price-aware protocol for cost-effective internet access**.

If this wasn’t enough, the Althea Network protocol **provides major telecom operators with the tools to optimize their existing infrastructure**. This shift allows for more distributed governance and revenue sharing, ultimately promoting a more resilient and adaptable network. As telecom giants adopt these practices, the industry moves closer to a decentralized model, unwillingly favoring its own decline."

"In Clatskanie, Oregon, and Abuja, Nigeria, traditional CIPs provided unreliable and expensive internet, leaving many residents with slow speeds and frequent outages. 

Althea Network transformed these situations by [engaging local communities](https://www.althea.net/community) to set up decentralized mesh networks, offering faster, more reliable, and cost-effective connectivity. This community-driven model reduced costs and allowed residents to earn income by hosting nodes. Improved internet access facilitated better remote work, education, telehealth services, and business opportunities, while also aiding local economic development. Althea Network's success in these regions demonstrates the potential for decentralized internet providers to bridge the digital divide and challenge the dominance of traditional CIPs in underserved areas."
