Jennifer Gidley:

"Alternatives to materialistic forms of scientific empiricism have been offered along the way through

* Goethe’s delicate empiricism (Holdrege, 2005; Robbins, 2006); 

* James’ cosmological realism (Gitre,2006); and 

* Whitehead’s process metaphysics (Gare, 1999),"

=History=

Jennifer Gidley:

"Arguably the origins of western science were based on Hermetic science until the 17th century CE(Kepler, 1619/1997).

* See also the Sussex University Newton Project  http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/prism.php?id=1 .

* Johannes Kepler linked his Hermetic writings with the ancient Egyptians in recently translated writings on the
musica mundana — or harmony of the spheres — available for the first time in English via the Schiller Institute in Washington, DC (Kepler, 1619/1997). More information about the Kepler Project  of the Schiller Institute is available. http://www.wlym.com/~animations/harmonies/index.php "
