Arab Commons

=Description=

Arab Commons is an initiative started in January 2007 as an ambitious project to promote and support the creation and development of Arabic content released under Creative Commons licenses.

The initiative aims to educate Arab artists, intellectuals and creative workers about the advantages of releasing their works under the Creative Commons licenses, the flexibility of these licenses to cater for the different requirements of the rights holders and the potential that can be unleashed by building a rich and vibrant Digital Commons for Arabic speakers.
