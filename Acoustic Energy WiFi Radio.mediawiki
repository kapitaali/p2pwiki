'''Acoustic Energy Wi-Fi Internet Radio.'''

=Description=

How does it work with out a computer you ask?

Simple...Just plug the radio into an AC power outlet located within range of your wireless internet signal and then press the power button to turn it on. The AE Wi-Fi Internet Radio automatically uploads available stations and lists them alphabetically by country and category. All you have to do is select a station and press play — it's really that simple!

The Acoustic Energy Wi-Fi Internet Radio takes the complexity out of internet radio, and makes it convenient and easy to access programs through a traditional table-top-style radio-like interface. And best of all, there are no subscription fees!"
