"Alexander Bard is a philosopher and futurologist based in Stockholm, Sweden. He is the author of five books: The Netocrats, The Global Empire, The Body Machines, Syntheism: Creating God in the Internet Age and Digital Libido: Sex, Power and Violence in the Network Society, all with his co-writer Jan Söderqvist.

Bard is a radical process philosopher, merging Hegel and Nietzsche with Whitehead and Deleuze, using human beings as the constant and technological disruption as the variable while working toward the deepest possible understanding of human history, contemporary society and the intensely technology-driven future that humanity is facing. Bard has also enjoyed a highly successful 25-year career as a producer and artist in the international music industry, and he is a celebrity in his native Sweden as the toughest judge on the TV shows Swedish Idol and Sweden's Got Talent."
