Represents [[Communautique]] along with my colleague Simon Roux, at the [[Berlin Commons Conference]].

In 2000, I co-founded the Global Community Networking Partnership (GlobalCN). Shortly thereafter, I founded (2001) the CMIC-Carrefour Mondial de l' Internet Citoyen (World Forum on Community Networking) which became a member of the GlobalCn Partnership. As CMIC director I was responsible for the organisation of the third GlobalCN conference in Montreal in 2002.My active participation in the emerging international networks aimed at the democratisation of communication resulted in 2002 in the creation of the CRIS (Communication Rights for an Information Society) campaign, of which I was one of the founding members.

I was actively involved in the preparation of the WSIS (World Summit on the Information Society) as part of different working groups of the civil society caucus. My participation at WSIS consisted also in the conceptualisation and co-organization of an Open Source Intelligence multicultural process involving more than 30 contributors from all continents and different cultural backgrounds. The result of this initiative on the major issues and debates of the Information Society was the launch of the publication "Word Matters, Multicultural perspectives on information societies", a quadrilingual 650-page book, at the WSIS in Tunis in November 2005.

After coordinating Media@McGill until 2007, I work now as a consultant, independent researcher and videographer on issues such as Science and Democracy, Social innovation and the Commons. I produced in 2010 a DVD for a “doculivre” named “Sciences et Démocratie” an a series of interviews on the issue to be distributed on the web."
