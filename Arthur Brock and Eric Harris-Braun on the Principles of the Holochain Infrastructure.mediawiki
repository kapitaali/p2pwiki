=Contextual Citation=

“Holochain creates currencies that are not speculative. It creates currencies that are based on actual production. People, for a long time, have been wondering why we have all these currencies when the government can issue as much of it as they want, whenever they want.  It's funny, in the blockchain world, they call their currencies non-fiat and government currencies - fiat, but blockchain currencies are also actually fiat.They are declared out of nowhere.  Whereas, if you do this other pattern of creating mutual credit currencies based on productive capacity, then you are actually creating something that represents actual value in the world and our economics can become based on value rather than speculation.”

=Description=

the mutation of consciousness as expressed in code:

"In this episode Utsav Jaiswal interviews Arthur Brock and Eric Harris-Braun, Co-Founders of Holochain - an Open Source framework for building fully distributed, peer-to-peer applications.

They talk about Holochain’s mission and values, how it differs from Blockchains, and how to manage distributed teams.

“What we've been interested in is really how do we collectively shape currents, flows for a better world, for greater collective intelligence, for coordinating and collaborating better.”- Arthur Brock“Holochain is what we've come to after a very long time and a lot of intense efforts in understanding those (biological) patterns of how to create tools for distributed collective intelligence... And Holochain is our answer to being able to do that.”- Eric Harris-Braun "
