"University of Technology, Sydney and Australian Centre for Independent Journalism, Sydney, Australia, May 13th, 2008:

Ali Abunimah describes how his site, Electronic Intifada, grew out of Nigel Perry's online diary of the 1990s "A Personal Story of the Israeli-Palestine Conflict" and his own correspondence in the 1990s with the American National Public Radio.

He also expresses his belief that eventually Israel and Palestine will be one country. His views are contained in his book, One Country: A Bold Proposal to End the Israeli-Palestinian Impasse (2006)"
