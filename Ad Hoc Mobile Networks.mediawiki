"Without a human administrator, an ad-hoc network must '''assemble itself from any devices that happen to be nearby, and adapt as devices move in and out of wireless range'''. And where office networks use powerful computers with separate routers, t'''he building blocks of ad-hoc mobile networks are low-power devices that must do their own wireless routing, forwarding signals from other devices that would otherwise be out of radio range'''.

A typical network could contain tens or even hundreds of these ‘embedded systems’, ranging from handheld computers down to ‘motes’: tiny units each equipped with a sensor, a microcontroller and a radio that can be scattered around an area to be monitored. Other devices could be mounted at fixed points, carried by robots, or worn as ‘smart clothing’ or ‘body area networks’."
