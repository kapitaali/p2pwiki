Eugene Kuchinov:

"The anarcho-biocosmist movement first emerged in 1920, in the form of the Biocosmist Creatorium, a small club within the Moscow section of the anarcho-universalists. In 1922, it was reconfigured as the completely independent Creatorium of Russian and Moscow Anarchist Biocosmists. Aleksandr Svyatogor’s key texts of the anarcho-biocosmic period were published in the journal Biokosmist [The Biocosmist], four issues of which were published in 1922, and the anthology Biokosmizm (Materialy) [Biocosmism (Materials)], three issues of which were published in 1921–1922."
