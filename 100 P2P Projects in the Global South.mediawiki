= In analogy with the project [[100 Women Who Are Co-Creating the P2P Society]], this is preparatory material for a series on p2p/commons projects in the Global South. Still very preliminary.

= Discussion and aims =

Open questions for contributors to help frame the project:

# What do we mean by Global South? 
# Is the focus geographical, economic or racial?
# Will the series be spearheaded by contributors from the global south?
# Is the series about projects or people?
