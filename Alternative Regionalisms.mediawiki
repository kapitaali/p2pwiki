=Description=

"Part of the Economic Justice, Corporate Power and Alternatives Programme, TNI’s Alternative Regionalisms project believes that socially just and environmentally sustainable alternatives to the current model of corporate-led globalisation will need to emerge at a regional level – in addition to the more usual civil society focus on local and national solutions. Working closely with social movements and coalitions of civil society organisations in the South and Europe, TNI combines network-building, research and policy advocacy to promote regional solutions to global economic, social and ecological crises.

Why Alternative Regionalisms? We see the regions as privileged arenas to develop and implement alternatives that place people and the environment before profit. This holds particularly true in the current context of global crises, where the need to move forward with the process of de-globalisation becomes more urgent than ever.

Regionalism offers the potential for policy autonomy in the South. Through alternative regional integration processes, countries would be able to take advantage of the diversity of natural, productive, financial, scientific and intellectual resources that exist in the region, strengthening regional capacities and facilitating endogenous development strategies, promoting cooperation rather than competition between neighbour states."
