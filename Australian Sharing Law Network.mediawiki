=Description=

"The Australian Sharing Law Network is an informal network of organisations and individuals interested in using the law to support the collaborative economy and the sharing of resources in our community.  Organisations participating in the network include AELA, UNSW Australia, and Melbourne Law School’s Sustainability Business Clinic.

AELA is interested in building the role of law to support Earth friendly practices such as: sharing resources, reducing material consumption and creating community based and democratically managed enterprises such as co-operatives."
